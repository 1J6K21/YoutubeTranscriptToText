Question 5: In the Mastering Geology assignment this week, we learned about Flood Basalts. One example was the Columbia River Flood Basalt Province. Which of the following are true about these flood basalts? (Select all that apply)
Type: multiple_answers_question
Answers:
  [ ] These flood basalts are the result of a single, massive lava flow with the horizontal planes caused by tectonic stresses after solidification. -> 
  [x] (Selected) Thick layers of basalt indicate many repeated eruptions of multiple lava flows, with the youngest flows at the top. -> Your Answer: (You left this blank)
  [x] (Selected) The relatively flat features of solidified flood basalts is indicative of the very low viscosity of the lava when it was erupted and emplaced. -> Your Answer: (You left this blank)
  [ ] These flood basalts are the result of dramatically explosive eruptions that produced lots of pyroclastic material that is intermixed within the layers. -> 
  [x] (Selected) The flood basalts have fine grained texture that indicates relatively fast, extrusive cooling. -> Your Answer: (You left this blank)

----------------------------------------

Question 6: Are rhyolite eruptions always explosive?
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] Yes, their high viscosity and high volatile content means they will always explode. -> 
  [ ] No, they are never explosive. -> 
  [ ] Yes, even when an eruption starts off effusive, it will always eventually explode due to a build up of pressure. -> 
  [x] (Selected) No, sometimes they produce lava domes that erupt very slowly over many years. -> 

----------------------------------------

Question 7: At which tectonic setting so most volcanoes exist?

----------------------------------------

Question 11: Identify the FALSE statement about volcanic gas hazards.
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] Sulfur volcanic gasses smell like rotten eggs, but that smell can disappear at high concentrations making if difficult to know if you are being exposed. -> 
  [x] (Selected) All volcanic gasses are toxic to people living near volcanoes. -> 
  [ ] Carbon dioxide gas is more dense than air. -> 
  [ ] Volcanic gasses can combine in the atmosphere to cause climate change. ->
