Question 1: Why does a higher temperature cause the viscosity of a magma to decrease?
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] heat causes the magma to dissolve in water, meaning it can flow easily like a river of water -> 
  [ ] heat increases bonding in a magma causing the atoms to resist moving past one another -> 
  [x] (Selected) heat breaks bonds between atoms and allows them to move easily past one another -> 
  [ ] heat causes atoms to break apart, allowing for the magma to flow easily -> 

----------------------------------------

Question 2: What is the geothermal gradient?
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] the increase in pressure with depth inside the Earth -> 
  [ ] the decrease in temperature of the Earth with increasing depth -> 
  [x] (Selected) the increases in temperature of the Earth with increased depth -> 
  [ ] the change in temperature with elevation gain in the atmosphere -> 

----------------------------------------

Question 3: The rock in the image below has both small and large crystals. This texture is called porphyritic. A likely explanation for the formation of this rock is:
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] The magma cooled rapidly, preserving voids left by gas bubbles. -> 
  [ ] The magma cooled slowly, forming only large crystals. -> 
  [x] (Selected) The magma cooled slowly at first, forming large crystals, and then quickly, forming small crystals from the remaining magma. -> 
  [ ] The magma cooled so rapidly that it produced a solid with no crystalline structure. -> 

----------------------------------------

Question 4: What is one way glassy texture forms?
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [x] (Selected) rapid cooling of lava -> 
  [ ] slow cooling of lava -> 
  [ ] slow cooling of magma -> 
  [ ] decompression of lava during eruption -> 

----------------------------------------

Question 5: What does pyroclastic texture in an igneous rock suggest about its formation?
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] The rock was formed by rapid crystallization after eruption. -> 
  [ ] The rock was formed in an intrusive setting. -> 
  [ ] The rock was formed from two distinct cooling episodes. -> 
  [x] (Selected) The rock was likely formed by a violent volcanic eruption. ->

Question 7: Based on what you learned in this module, and using the following image, which of the following is an appropriate description of how the conditions change from the first blue dot to the second blue dot.
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] An area of solid rock undergoes increases in pressure and temperature as it is buried. -> 
  [ ] An area of solid rock in the subsurface is heated quickly in place and starts to melt. -> 
  [ ] Magma erupts at the surface and then rapidly cools to a solid. -> 
  [x] (Selected) An area of solid rock deep in the subsurface quickly rises to a lower depth/pressure and melts. -> 

----------------------------------------

Question 8: Magma rises for two reasons: 1. It is [ Select ] ["less buoyant", "more dense", "more mafic", "less dense"] than surrounding rock. 2. Overlying rocks creates [ Select ] ["less buoyant", "tension", "a high geothermal gradient", "less felsic", "pressure", "more buoyant", "more dense"] on the magma causing it to rise.
Type: multiple_dropdowns_question
Dropdown Options:
  - less buoyant, more dense, more mafic, less dense
  - less buoyant, tension, a high geothermal gradient, less felsic, pressure, more buoyant, more dense
Answers:
  [ ] less buoyant -> 
  [ ] more dense -> 
  [ ] more mafic -> 
  [x] (Selected) less dense -> 
  [ ] tension -> 
  [ ] a high geothermal gradient -> 
  [ ] less felsic -> 
  [x] (Selected) pressure -> 
  [ ] more buoyant ->

Question 9: During a hike, you pick up the igneous rock shown below. a. The texture of this rock is best described as: [ Select ] ["phaneritic", "aphanitic"] b. Because of this texture, we can say with some certainty that the magma that formed it cooled [ Select ] ["quickly", "slowly"] c. If I told you this rock is ultramafic you could tell me that it likely came from the [ Select ] ["continental crust", "mantle"]
Type: multiple_dropdowns_question
Dropdown Options:
  - phaneritic, aphanitic
  - quickly, slowly
  - continental crust, mantle
Answers:
  [x] (Selected) phaneritic -> 
  [ ] aphanitic -> 
  [ ] quickly -> 
  [x] (Selected) slowly -> 
  [ ] continental crust -> 
  [x] (Selected) mantle ->
