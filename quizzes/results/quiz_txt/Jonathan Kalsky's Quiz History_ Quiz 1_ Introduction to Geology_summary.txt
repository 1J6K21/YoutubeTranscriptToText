Question 4: Since temperatures in Earth increase with depth, why is the inner core solid?
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] Earth's interior does not reach temperatures high enough to melt the material of the inner core. -> 
  [ ] The inner core is shedding the heat so quickly that melting does not have time to occur. -> 
  [ ] Temperatures increase to a certain point before leveling off below the melting point of the core. -> 
  [x] (Selected) The pressures in the core are immense and keep it in a solid state despite the temperature. ->
