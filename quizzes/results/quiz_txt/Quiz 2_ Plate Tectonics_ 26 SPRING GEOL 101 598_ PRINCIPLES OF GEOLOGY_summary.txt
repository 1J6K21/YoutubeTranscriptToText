Question 6: Rigid lithospheric plates move _______.
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] as they float on oceanic crust -> 
  [x] (Correct) over the more ductile asthenosphere -> 
  [ ] on the hotter mantle peridotite -> 
  [ ] due to tidal forces -> 

----------------------------------------

Question 7: How can hot spots leave evidence of plate motion?
Type: multiple_choice_question
Answers:
  [ ] Polar wandering creates hot spot patterns, showing plate motion -> 
  [ ] Hot spots move, indicating plate tectonics is occurring ->

  [ ] Hot spots are always found at plate boundaries -> 

----------------------------------------

Question 8: The angle difference between magnetic north and true north is called declination . Inclination is the angle of a magnetic needle or magnetic mineral relative to the Earth's surface and tells us the latitude at which a magnetic mineral formed or at which the compass needle is currently located.
