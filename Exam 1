howdy everyone did you miss me all right well i'm back on camera for module two um we're going to be talking about plate tectonics which is a very important concept that is going to be very important for all the topics that we talk about going forward so all this information is really laying the groundwork for everything else we're going to talk about this semester and i'd like to be on camera for this i like teaching this kind of topic in person because i use a lot of hand gestures so i don't know if my hand gestures are helpful they kind of help me understand some of these processes so i'll be here in the little corner of your screen hopefully not in the way using hand gestures whenever it's it's necessary but let me go ahead and share my screen with you guys see if i can get this going all right so hopefully you can see my screen again this is the beginning of module two on plate tectonics but before we really get into the details of plate tectonics it's important to start out with the history about how we got to know what we know today and that started with a theory called continental drift so continental drift to plate tectonics how did we get there well until the late 1960s most geologists believe that the positions of the continents in the ocean basins were fixed and they didn't actually move into that belief and it was first proposed in 1915 that's quite a long time ago after world war ii scientific developments led to the unfolding of the theory of plate tectonics plate tectonics refers to the movement of lithospheric plates that shifts continents and causes volcanism earthquakes and mountain building and as you'll soon learn plate tectonics is responsible for creating almost all of the landforms we see on earth so continental drift was a hypothesis that was first proposed in 1915 by a german scientist named alfred wegner and he published this book called the origins of continents and oceans and it contained his theory of continental drift and the notion of pangaea he proposed that all the land masses on earth were once united in a giant supercontinent during the paleozoic in the mesozoic eras now what exactly is pangea hopefully this animation will start to work but pangaea means all earth or all land wagner believed that pangaea broke part forming the continents in the oceans as we know them today he theorized that pangaea consisted of two major parts larasia in the north and gondwana in the south today eurasia and north america are the remnants of eurasia and south america africa india and australia and antarctica form the principal fragments of gondwana so wegner's notion of continental drift was the fragmentation of pangaea and the slow movement of continents away from the supercontinent this hypothesis was based on much more than just the match between continental outlines noticed by many others such as the most famously sir francis bacon all the way in the 1600s even you as children probably looked at a map of the world and thought gee these continents look like puzzle pieces they must have gone together but that wasn't the only evidence wegner had fenger gathered a lot of circumstantial evidence as well closely related fossil plants and animals that seem likely to evolve in the same geographic region were now scattered across south africa south america india australia and even antarctica paleozoic and mesozoic rock formations also seemed closely related though they are now separated by the atlantic and indian oceans so again we have lots of evidence supporting continental drift that the continental jigsaw puzzle and that identical fossil organisms were found on multiple continents again africa south america india antarctica and australia which are now separated by massive oceans so how did the animals cross the vast oceans well a lot of people had theories about this they thought maybe they rafted across the oceans but probably the most likely reason is that the continents had to have moved themselves not only did the rock record in the fossil record seem to match up pretty nicely but there's even matching mountain ranges across the north atlantic ocean now there was a discovery of evidence for glacial period dating to the late paleozoic era in southern africa south america australia and india during that period which was about 300 million years ago vast ice sheets covered extensive portions of the southern hemisphere including india much of that contained evidence that this glaciation presently lies within 30 degrees latitude of the equator in the subtropical and tropical climates how in the world were there glaciers in india and africa and south america when those are kind of warm places today some explained this even as a global glaciation where the entire planet must have experienced a period of extreme cooling if these places were covered by ice however wegner rejected this hypothesis because he had geologic evidence that supported the existence of tropical swamps in the northern hemisphere at the same time the glaciers were in the southern hemisphere very strange the only way this could be explained was if the continents themselves moved as possible as wegner's theory seemed there was still one major problem he didn't have the mechanism to explain these movements that was still unknown so why was wegner unable to overturn the established scientific views of his day that inability to identify a credible mechanism for continental drift was really why his theory didn't take place he also incorrectly proposed the gravitational forces of the moon's sun were capable of moving the continents and he incorrectly suggested that the continents broke through the ocean kind of like icebreakers so there was strong opposition to his hypothesis from all areas of the scientific community so his his theory or his hypothesis was rejected continental drift was replaced by plate tectonic theory after the discovery of seafloor spreading which we will explore in the next video and that's it for this one these videos are going to be ending pretty awkwardly because i don't know how to quickly stop recording so thanks for sticking through all of module one and starting module two and we will continue on to seafloor spreading

howdy everyone and welcome to the seafloor spreading video in module two this is the second video in module two all right so the idea that the sea floor itself moves and is also carrying the continents with it as it spreads from a central rift axis was proposed by a gentleman named harold hammond hess in the 1960s and it was that makes what we know as plate tectonics and it wasn't until the 1960s and that was thanks in largely in part for world war ii actually when mid-oceanic ridges were recognized as not just submarine mountain chains but as locations where hot rock continually rises from deep in the mantle melting and then solidifying to form new igneous rocks that are mafic and calm rock is soon to be pushed away horizontally by still newer rock forcing its way up from below all along the mid-oceanic ridges since these mid-ocean ridges are areas where new lithosphere forms and diverges the earth's lithosphere is divided into segments these large fragments are separated along these ridges and these segments are called lithosphere plates or tectonic plates if new material is being created and pushed outward then there must be older material being pushed together elsewhere probably destroyed when plates are being pushed together one can plunge beneath the other be destroyed and these are called subduction zones and we'll all get into more detail about these specific boundaries here later in the module so here's a map showing the ages of the sea floor supportionic crust curve based on this map let me see if i can get my laser pointer so the warm colors are young so red is zero to two million years old going all the way to blues the cool colors are very old about 144 to 208 million years old so where are the youngest oceanic crusts found in the world again these are going to be the warm colors the red now you can see that the the warm colors the red colors are kind of near the center of most of the ocean basins and this is actually occurring all along these mid-ocean ridges that you can see so the youngest crust occurs at mid-ocean ridges now where is the oldest oceanic crust remember the blues well you can see the oldest ocean appears to be along the coasts of continents farther away from the ridge and it looks like at the center of these oceans especially the atlantic you can see it really nice and they seem to be getting older the farther away from that center that you go and that's because the sequel is spreading so the crust does indeed get older the farther away you are from the rich so based on just this map you can you can tell a lot about earth not only the ages of the crust and where new crust is being formed but where do you think the spreading rate is the greatest because not everywhere are we creating new crust at the same rate if you look at the pacific ocean here you can see that the color bands are much wider and that is directly related to this the rate of spreading in the pacific ocean we are forming new crust much faster than we are in the atlantic and that's why these color bands are much wider so the pacific ocean is creating new crust quickest whereas the atlantic and the indian oceans appear to be spreading at a slower rate and that's because the bands are narrower the color bands are narrower and these color bands represent age now also looking at this map why do you think the oldest sea floor which according to this is 208 million years old or less than 200 million years old we could say why is that the oldest why don't we see anything older than that if the earth is over four billion years old well that's because as new seafloor is created it's very very hot so it's very very hot at the center of the ocean basins where it's being formed and as it's being pushed away over time and as it ages it becomes colder because it's farther away from that hot center and it just has time for it to cool down and what happens to things when they get colder they end up getting denser and eventually this crust will become dense enough to subduct into the mantle and be destroyed and we'll talk about this process later on in this module but there's a whole lot that you can tell about our planet just by looking at a map of the age of the ocean floor now following world war ii and the reason why this plate tectonic theory didn't take place until about world war ii is because all the technology that was exploding around this time and we also had a pretty good interest in trying to map the seafloor trying to find submarines that could be hiding um so we really started um mapping the sea floor and discovering these these mid-ocean ridges these mountain chains on the bottom of the ocean floor so following the war oceanographers with new equipment were able to explore in more detail the sea floor and they found oceanic ridge systems that wind through all of the major oceans they discovered that no oceanic crust was older than 180 million years old or really 200 million years old and they found fins so these developments and many others actually led to the theory of plate tectonics so a little bit more about the theory of plate tectonics the lithosphere remember the lithosphere is the crust and the uppermost mantle it's that rigid material is kind of floating you could say on the asthenosphere which remember is that hotter more ductile weaker region kind of like silly putty underneath the lithosphere and these two layers the lithosphere and the asthenosphere move independently of each other and that lithosphere that rigid material is broken into numerous segments that we call lithosphere plates or tectonic plates and these plates are in constant motion and they're not all moving in the same direction either so they're interacting with each other at boundaries which we'll talk about later on in this module so the plates are moving and plates move as somewhat rigid units relative to each other and most interactions and deformations occur along these plate boundaries and we have different kind of interactions and different types of deformations we see depending on what type of boundary we're dealing with again we'll talk about all the different boundaries later on in this module so the earth is split up into many tectonic plates take some time in looking at this map to see what plate you are from probably most of us are from the north american plate but not all of us i know i'm from the north american plate what plate are you from now a little plate tectonics 101 i find this slide to be really useful summary remember the lithosphere which is that rigid layer it's relatively thin it's cool or cooler and it's hard it's rigid whereas the asthenosphere below is weaker and it's hotter and it's ductile it's like silly putty that's what's kind of our lithosphere is kind of floating on so this lithosphere that rigid material is broken into large fragments that we call plates and these plates are floating on that silly putty that asthenosphere and these plates are constantly moving around an average rate of movements about three centimeters per year that's about the rate that your fingernails grow that's how fast our plates are moving and all these plates are interacting with each other at what we call plate boundaries now these interactions of the plate boundaries is what results in a lot of hazards that we deal with on earth like earthquakes and volcanoes and they also form a lot of the landforms we see like mountains and ocean basins and a lot of others that we'll talk about now these plates are interacting with each other because they're constantly moving and some of them are not moving in the same direction so they do bump into each other or interact with each other at what things that we call plate boundaries and there are three main plate boundary types and there will be a there'll be a video on each of these different types the three plate boundary types are called divergent you can see the divergent plate right here this is a diversion plate boundary and what happens at divergent plate boundary is we have plates moving away from each other they're diverging the second plate boundary type is called convergent which i have pictured here and you'll notice the plate motions are coming towards each other they're colliding they're converging now convergent boundaries are probably the most complex because it depends on what type of lithosphere is colliding they're going to behave differently is it two oceanic lithospheres coming together where we're gonna have the older one subduct under the denser one is it two continents coming together where remember continental thrust is not very dense and when that happens they buckle upwards instead of subducting or do we have an ocean and a continent colliding and in that case the denser of the two is going to subduct which would be the oceanic crust so we have an entire video that we talk about convergent boundaries that we'll get into more detail and then the third boundary type is called transform and transform we don't have anything colliding and we don't have anything splitting apart rather we just have two plates that are simply sliding past one another and we have a whole video that talks about transform as well alright so now that you know what makes plate tectonic theory where it's the continental drip from alfred wegener combined with harry hess's c4 spreading now we can talk about the details of plate tectonics such as the boundary types what we can expect to see at these boundaries what kind of hazards are associated with these and what kind kind of landforms do they create on earth and i will see you in our next video

all right how do you get everyone and thank you for continuing on with module two we are finally going to get started with the exciting um topic of plate tectonic boundaries and we're going to start with the first boundary type we're going to start with divergent plate boundaries so divergent plate boundaries are also sometimes called constructive plate margins i think your textbook uses that term sometimes this is where new ocean floor is generated as two plates move apart so this is where that seafloor spreading actually occurs and most people are spreading at oceanic ridges so that's where we see most of these is the longest topographic feature on earth's surface i don't know if you've ever looked at a map of the ocean floor or you can even see it in google earth again because you can see all these features that i talk about throughout the entire semester but that oceanic ridge system which is just that underwater mountain chain it extends over 70 000 kilometers in length i mean it is connected through all of the ocean basins of the world um and it is such an amazing feature you can see it in google earth you can see it on almost any map that you find of the earth but at this oceanic ridge system why there's a ridge there in the first place is because of these divergent plate boundaries in this seaforce spreading now oceanic ridges and c4 spreading are connected again we have ridges there because we have hot mantle rising above as the plates are being pulled apart this creates our sea floor spreading this is where our diverging plate boundary is along the crest of the ring rift valley and sea floor spreading again is the mechanism that operates along this ridge system to create new ocean floor now i mentioned the average spreading rate is about three centimeters per year that's true it's about the rate of your fingernails it can go even higher than that up to seven centimeters per year i think your textbook has the average spreading rate to be listed as five centimeters per year but i think on average really it's around three now the mid-atlantic ridge has a spreading rate of about two centimeters per year and we saw that in the map we saw the map of the age of the sea floor in the last video and you saw that the bands of colors which represent age were narrower in the mid-atlantic and that's because mid-atlantic is spreading i think at the slowest rate and that's two centimeters per year now remember we saw in the pacific ocean that the color bands were wider on that sea floor map and that represents age and that's because in the pacific ocean things are moving much more quicker and the east pacific rise which is the fastest spreading ridge in the pacific ocean is spreading at a rate of 15 centimeters per year so much faster now here are some useful diagrams again showing you that divergent plate boundary in the process that's being associated with this so at this location we have an upwelling in the mantle a very hot mantle material that's able to rise at the spreading centers and those located at these divergent plate boundaries and that hot molten material is going to cool and solidify on the ocean floor and create new oceanic crust so this is where we have new crust being created and at these spreading centers or these diversion plate boundaries not only do we have volcanoes but we can also have earthquakes associated with these as well of course they're not usually high in magnitude and at these spreading centers that's where we see those ridges those underwater mountain chains and here it shows very nicely you can see that mid-atlantic ridge right here that's where we have the plates being split apart here in the middle of the atlantic so on the eastern side of the mid-atlantic ridge the plate is moving to the east on the western side of that mid-atlantic the center we call that a divergent plate boundary because plates are moving away from each other they're diverging and we have hot mantle material rising up and forming new oceanic crust and that oceanic crust is being pushed horizontally in opposite directions because new crust new material is constantly coming upwards and it's pushing the old stuff outwards so again c4 spreading that's what we have going on here at divergent fake boundaries now here's a really cool map of the ocean floor this is the mid-atlantic ridge again so right here you can see very clearly and again look at google earth you can see this in google earth also you can see that ridge all through the center of the atlantic ocean very very clearly and this is where we have oceanic crust and oceanic crust splitting apart and you can see that there is a ridge here almost like an underwater mountain chain in the center we have that rift valley that little canyon that you can get right at the central part of that but you notice this light blue here this represents shallower water and that's because the ridge is a topographic high here so the water is slightly shallower and as you move away you start to see it get deeper and deeper and that's because as the crust is pushed outwards it is aging so it's getting there so it sinks down a little bit and you can see this feature in the middle of the pacific ocean and the indian ocean as well and this feature actually connected throughout all of the ocean basins remember up to 70 000 kilometers this this extensive ridge continues but i think the mid-atlantic ridge is probably the most famous example of divergent plate boundary now these things are happening underneath the water so we're not able to really visit these places but there's one really cool place iceland where you can see the divergent plate boundary on land so you can actually see this process going on and iceland sits in the atlantic ocean so it's actually where the north american plate and the eurasian plate are moving apart and iceland sits right on top now isis is kind of a complex region because not only is it sitting right on top of that divergent playback about later on in the semester and at hot spots we have volcanic activity as well so divergent plate boundary creates volcanoes because plates are splitting apart allowing that hot and volcanic activity even more so we have even more crust being formed at this location and so much of it is being formed that it is above the water now creating the island of iceland so iceland's a perfect example of a dive now i mentioned that most divergent plate boundaries are occurring in the middle of the ocean but we do have some that occur in continents and we call that continental rifting and this is when we have two continents splitting apart instead of the oceans splitting apart and continental grifting occurs when a divergent plate boundary occurs within a conch and creates more smaller segments a continental rift is usually an elongated depression almost like a big rift valley and it develops it and it's stretching and it's moving away so the land is starting to sink and it creates that continental rift or rift valley deeper and it'll form a narrow scene and eventually as it continues splitting apart that narrow sea that's formed will become a new ocean basin and that's how we have the atlantic ocean and we have the pacific ocean that's how those ocean basins were formed in the beginning on earth and east africa and we call it the east african rift now remember divergent plate boundaries this is where we have plates moving away splitting of material to rise and form volcanoes like the volcanic mid-ocean ridges but in continental rift zones it also forms volcanoes and in east almond jar so mount kilimanjaro is a direct consequence of plate tectonics so continent here in africa is being split apart in several locations you see that it is moving away from each other and we have a narrow sea that's starting to form in between some of these rest zones and eventually this continues long enough we will start to form a brand new ocean here and again i have included kilimanjaro is a direct consequence of this geologic process taking place divergent plate boundary continental rift zone so here's just a diagram showing you how the continental rifting takes place very similar to the splitting apart we get the two continental plates splitting apart so when those plates begin to pull apart we get that upwelling of hot material getting closer and closer to the surface and then as that continues the land's being pulled apart that crust is starting to thin out and it's starting to sink and it starts it will sink low enough that it'll start to fill with water and create a new sea and if this continues long enough eventually we'll have shins form all right so here's a little summary of divergent flake boundaries divergent plate boundaries are where two tectonic plates move apart or diverge this can occur between two continental plates like in east africa where we're going to form a new ocean eventually and they can occur on earth in the middle of the ocean most of those divergent boundaries are found at those mid-ocean ridges that extensive underwater mountain chain that is found throughout all the ocean basins and the process where these oceanic plates are diverging forming new ocean lithosphere that is known as seafloor spreading so that's why we talk about seafloor spreading before we get into divergent plate boundaries because they go hand in hand and some of the hazards we expect to see they're mostly low in magnitude and of course volcanoes we see volcanoes all up and down the mid-ocean ridges that's what's actually forming our new ocean crust but even in continental rift zones like mount and jarrow all right so now we're finished talking about divergent plate boundaries the next video we're going to explore convergent plate boundaries which are a little bit more complex so buckle up and i'll see you there

all right howdy everyone um welcome to the next video in module two on plate tectonics now in the last video we talked about divergent plate boundaries which is kind of related to that sea floor spreading so i think usually for most folks that one's a little bit easier to understand now i mentioned convergent plate boundaries are probably the most complex boundaries that we deal with and you'll see why here in a moment so this video we're just going to be talking about convergent plate boundaries now this is actually the second time i'm attempting to record this because i'm at home and i have two dogs i don't know if you can see one of them um fedex truck showed up so it ruined my whole video so hopefully that doesn't happen this time and if it does i'm just gonna we're just gonna go with it all right so moving on convergent plate boundaries and i hear my robot vacuum has just turned on so hopefully it doesn't come in this room all right so convergent plate boundaries they occur when we have two tectonic plates moving together or converging or collided subduction zones which we kind of talked about subduction zones a little bit they include folded mountain ranges and then they have hazards such as volcanoes and some of the most explosive volcanoes on earth occur at convergent boundaries and we also have earthquake zones and some of the largest earthquakes in earth's history happen at convergent plant boundaries so convergent plate boundaries are probably one of the most dangerous places on earth they have the most hazards now i mentioned before that convergent plate boundaries are complex and that's because it depends on what kind of colliding with another continental plate and in that case remember continental crust is not as dense so they're actually not dense enough to subdivide since they're not very dense what happens is is they crumble upwards and they create those folded mountain ranges now we could all complete now remember our oceanic plates are thinner but they are more dense than the continental plate which is the important part so when continental plate and an oceanic plate collide because the oceanic plate is denser it's actually able to slide underneath the continental plate and subduct into the manifold and this can produce some mountain ranges because it's not it doesn't smoothly subduct underneath can get stuck and start building some deformation it builds some pretty mountain ranges but the important note to to remember about continental versus oceanic convergent plate boundaries is that as that oceanic plate subducts underneath the other and the water with the oceanic plate influences the melting point it's going to reach a depth at which that oceanic plate is going to start to melt and melted hot stuff is less dense than the other stuff so it's going to rise up and that melted material is going to make its way to the surface on the continental side and that mountain range that's formed at these boundaries are actually volcanic now we could also have oceanic plates versus oceanic plate and in that case whichever one is denser is going to subduct remember when we talked about seafloor spreading and the older the crust gets the colder it gets and the denser it gets well when two oceanic plates collide whichever one is older is going to be denser so that older more dense oceanic crust is going to subduct underneath the other and we have similar things happening here like we do with continental versus oceanic where we're going to get that subductive plate that's eventually going to melt at a certain depth and rise to the surface and it's going to form volcanoes on the ocean floor and eventually these volcanoes can reach great heights and actually form island chains like the island of japan for example so again convergent plate boundaries are super complex because it all depends on what crust is being involved at the collision zone now convergent plate boundaries with subduction the important thing to remember about subduction zone is that only oceanic crust is actually dense enough to subduct continental crust will never subduct it's not dense enough to go into our mantle so subduction zones only occur where we have oceanic crust involved and the two plates moving towards each other the leading edge of one of those plates it has to be oceanic crust slides beneath the other so whichever is denser if it's two oceanic plates the denser oceanic plate is going to subduct but it'll always be oceanic never continental crust so where lithosphere descends and that's what we call subduct into the mantle this is what we call subduction zones and along subduction zones we see deep ocean trenches remember in the last module i showed a google earth image off the coast of japan and you saw that trench that occurred all along japan that's a deep ocean trench and why that deep ocean trench is there is because we have a subduction zone we have oceanic plate subducting underneath another oceanic plate at japan and the island of japan is actually formed because of the volcanic activity that's occurring at that subduction zone so these deep ocean trenches they're long linear depressions in the ocean floor and it's because we have a plate sliding underneath the other and it creates that depression in the sea floor that trench as that subduction takes place and deep ocean trenches they're produced when only oceanic crust remember consonant crust does not subduct when oceanic lithosphere descends into the mantle along subduction zones that's when we get those deep ocean trenches and japan's not the only example we also have a really pronounced trench at the peru chile trench you may have heard about the mariana trench the deepest point in earth and we have another trench called the tonga trench but really remember i talked about google earth and how much i love it you can go into google earth and see these trenches and you can see these trenches all along the pacific ocean remember i kind of briefly mentioned it the ring of fire the ring of fire is a ring of subduction zones and you can see it very pronouncedly in a map of the sea floor because they have trenches all along them and everywhere you have these deep ocean trenches you have oceanic crust being subducted now this brings us back to the question of why is the sea floor generally less than 200 million years old that is because as the seafloor ages remember when we talk about sea floor spreading as the seafloor ages and it's pushed horizontally it cools and eventually becomes dense and dense enough to subduct into the mantle and this is what happens at subduction zones it gets cold and dense enough to start subducting and remember the earth isn't expanding so if new crust is being created then we must have crust being pushed upwards or destroyed altogether at these subduction zones at convergent boundaries now oceanic versus continental convergence same thing as when we have the two oceanic plates where the denser the two come um subducts but in oceanic versus continental it's a little bit easier to remember because the oceanic crust is always going to subduct that continental crust will never sit up so that denser oceanic slab will begin to sink beneath the mantle and the continental plate is very buoyant so it kind of sits on top and at a depth of about 1000 kilometers or so that's when we start to have partial melting and at this step it's triggered when the water from the subducting plate mixes with the hot asthenosphere so the water is actually going to lower the melting point a little bit and that's why at this depth of about a thousand kilometers we start to get partial melting of that oceanic plate and this generates magma and that magma results in volcanic mountain chains called a continental volcanic ark some great examples of continental volcanic arms include the andes and even here in our own country the cascade range like mount st helens so here's just a diagram showing that convergent margin or subduction zone where we have oceanic crust meeting continental crust again the oceanic crust subducts underneath the continental crust and this is because the oceanic crust is denser always remember that the denser crust will always subduct and it has to be oceanic continental is not dense enough to subduct ever and at these convergent margins you know we get volcanoes i talked about that volcano continental arc like the cascade mountains mount st helens but we also get associate we also get earthquakes associated with this so we get volcanoes we get earthquakes and some features we see are those trenches even off the coast of oregon and washington we have a trench just like in japan and we also get mountain belts remember these mountain belts are going to be volcanic so the volcanoes will always be located on the continental side of the boundary now why is that well we have ocean oceanic plate we have continental plate remember continental plate is not dense enough to subduct only the oceanic plate will subduct and it slides underneath the continent and it has to reach a certain depth which is about a thousand kilometers in order for it to start melting because that's when the pressures and temperature promote melting now once it starts to melt produces magma which rises to the surface on the continental side so again volcanoes at oceanic versus continental convergent boundaries will always be located on the continental side now these boundaries are probably the most dangerous now when we have melting and we'll talk about this when we get to the volcano module but just to introduce it we have some of the most explosive volcanoes at these boundaries and why is that well oceanic crust is melting and it's mafic in composition which is usually kind of runny magma or runny lava and you wouldn't think it would be explosive but as it rises up through the continental crust it also melts some stuff along the way and it melts some continental crust material which is felsic and we'll talk about this later so you don't really need to memorize it now but it melts a little bit of that continental crust material which is felsic which means it has a lot of silica and silica makes our magma or lava very sticky and gas gets trapped in it very easily so the magma that's produced here at oceanic versus continental subduction zones is very sticky thick and full of gases so whenever it does erupt it often is very explosive i don't know if you've ever seen images or watched videos of the mount st helens eruption but that was a very explosive eruption and it is a direct consequence of the geological processes taking place here with oceanic versus continental crust converging now the earthquakes here are also deadly we get something called mega thrust earthquakes now as that plate is subducting underneath the continent it's not subducting smoothly remember i said it kind of up words and forms those mountains in the first place but they also get stuck and they can get stuck for long periods of time they're still moving so when they get stuck you have all of this stress and strain building up and eventually it's going to get unstuck and that's when we have an earthquake and when it gets unstuck it kind of bounces upwards and when that happens because it's happening underwater that subduction zone it's going to push a whole bunch of water upwards so not only are you going to produce a very large earthquake when this happens but when you push that water upwards it's going to create a tsunami so these types of convergent boundaries are very deadly not only because you have explosive volcanoes and mega thrust earthquakes but you also have the added hazard of tsunami now here's just showing another example of oceanic versus continental convergence and this is showing you the cascadia margin remember this is where i have research experience at the cascadia subduction zone offshore organ in washington so here's the subduction zone right here and you can see what's happening underneath the earth at this boundary we have the wanda fuca plate which isn't which is an oceanic crust and it's colliding with the north american plate which has continental crust so of course the oceanic crust is going to be the one that ducks underneath because it's denser and we reach about 100 kilometers depth here a continental volcanic ark called the cascades and you can see here just one example of one of the volcanoes found here mount hood we also have lots of volcanoes found in the cascades here's another one mount rainier in washington it is an active volcano and again it's a direct consequence of that convergent plate boundary and then here's probably the more famous one here's a photo showing mount st helens during the 1980 eruption this is again a direct consequence of that convergent oceanic versus continental boundary and again why is it happening well we have a lot going on here off the coast of the western united states and even into canada we have that cascadia subduction zone this is where that juan de fuca plate is subducting underneath our north american plate producing some melting in those cascade mountains we get some large mega thrust earthquakes about once every 600 years on this particular region and with that we could also get tsunami although we haven't had a major tsunami hit this area in a while but we are due for it and you also get those underwater landslides which we don't really talk about too much in this class but i have a lot of experience researching these underwater landslides that occur here but if you notice this diagram it's not just a subduction zone that we have going on here there's also a diverging plate boundary here as well the wanafucka ridge so we actually have a ridge outward which is forcing the water frugal plate to move to the east whereas the north american plates moving to the west so that's why we have that collision happening right there and eventually the whole wanafuco plate will probably be subducted underneath the north american plate and then that will begin the pacific plate colliding with the north american plate possibly so it's not just the cascades where we have this going on i mentioned the ring of fire here's that ring of fire this is just showing all the subduction zones along the pacific ocean here's the cascadian seduction zone that we just talked about with mount st helms we also have a famous one called the aleutian trench remember trenches are where the subductions are located we have that japan triple peen trench the java trench the tonga trench here's that peru chili trench now again i really recommend you looking at google earth it is so much fun but you can see these trenches all along the planet and everywhere you see these trenches that's when you know you have subduction going on and the ring of fire is famous because this is where we have a lot of natural hazards like our explosive volcanoes but really our metathrust earthquakes and associated tsunami all right so we talked about oceanic versus continental convergence now we're going to talk about oceanic versus oceanic so when two oceanic slabs converge one is going to descend beneath the other or subduct which one is that it's going to be whichever one is denser how do we know which one is denser it's going to be whichever one is older so the older more dense oceanic slab is going to subduct underneath the other one and as with our oceanic continental convergence we also get partial melting that initiates that volcanic activity as well and if the volcanoes emerge out of the water they form islands so here we get volcanic island arms or sometimes we just call them island parks are formed and examples of these are the aleutian islands off of alaska those chain of islands that are formed along the subduction zone and the mariana islands and of course japan which i've already mentioned so here's a diagram showing that subduction zone where we have oceanic versus oceanic very similar to oceanic versus continental now oceanic versus oceanic the denser colder older crust is going to subduct underneath the other and it's adding water as it subducts which is going to lower the melting point and it's going to promote partial melting at a certain depth because of the pressures and temperatures and the water added promote that melting that melted material is going to form magma that magma is going to rise to the surface and it's going to form a volcano now this is oceanic versus oceanic so the volcanoes are not going to be on a continent but they will be on the sea floor and if these volcanoes get large enough they will pop out of the water and they will form islands like japan or the lucian islands but they're not considered continental crust material they're oceanic crust materials just so much crust material that it's actually above the water creating these island arcs now just like with oceanic versus continental boundary we get those explosive volcanoes now because as the magma rises it also melts stuff along the way and it can melt i don't know if you can see here the sediments that are sitting on the sea floor these sediments even though it's on oceanic crust the sediments came from a continent so they're made up of continental material they have silica remember i said silica makes magma lava very sticky and very explosive so these volcanoes can also be explosive in nature now we also get those mega thrust earthquakes because anytime we have subduction going on it's not a smooth process it gets stuck sometimes and when it gets stuck it's going to get unstuck at some point and it's going to form that earthquake and of course we're definitely underwater here when that happens it's going to displace water and it's going to form a tsunami so at these zones we also have explosive volcanoes we also have large magnitude earthquakes just like the 2011 tohoku earthquake that we talked about and tsunami just like in japan so these are also very dangerous places on earth to live so here's just showing another example of oceanic versus continental convergence here we have the aleutian trench this is alaska here i don't know if you've ever looked at a map of the world you've noticed these chain of islands that kind of come off of alaska well this is where we have a subduction zone and if you look at google earth i'm telling you download people you can see that trench right along there as well because that's where the subduction is occurring and on these islands this is where we have volcanoes and that's what's actually forming the islands the islands are volcanic so this is our volcanic island parks this is a great example what i'm talking about now probably my favorite example is japan is mount fuji now i've never been to japan but it's on my bucket list mount fuji especially for some reason i feel like when i die i want my ashes at mount fuji i have no idea why but i feel like that's where i belong but mount fuji as beautiful as it is is a very dangerous volcano and it is a direct consequence of oceanic versus oceanic convergent plate boundary so here is what i'm talking about this is the island japan here's that japan trench and here's where the actual tahuka earthquake took place this is where it ruptured this is part of the plate boundary that got unstuck during that event and actually pushed the island up and towards the east so this is what makes it so so dangerous and mount fuji as beautiful as it is is a reminder that the processes going on here are very dangerous all right so now on to our third type of convergent plate boundary this is where we could have two continents colliding now remember i said only oceanic crust can subduct continental crust is not dense enough to subduct into our mantle it's too buoyant so when we have two continents colliding that can it's going to crumple upwards because it can't subduct it's not dense enough but what starts these two continents colliding in the first place well there actually had to be subduction at some point because the subduction zone when we have oceanic plate subducting underneath a continent eventually it's going to close an ocean completely and on the other side of that ocean we have a continent so we have ocean ocean ocean subducting underneath the continent subducting underneath the continent oh boy here we go all the oceanic crust is gone boom continents collide subduction stops because that that continent cannot subduct so what happens at that point it starts crumpling upwards and we get those folded mountain ranges so continued subduction will eventually bring two continents together forming these continent versus continent collisions and the continental lithosphere is less dense buoyant so it can't subduct so instead of because our planet isn't expanding if we have new cross being formed it has to be destroyed or moved upwards right so here we have continental continental convergence we have two continents colliding since we can't expand the earth it's going to move upwards and it can't subduct because it's not dense enough so this results in continental collision and produces those folded melted mountain belts and deformed rocks and some examples of these probably the most famous is the himalayas and then also the alps and even the appalachian mountains here in our country are a result from a continental continental collision although it's not happening anymore but it is evidence that we had a continent colliding with us at some point in the past so here's a diagram showing that convergent boundary where we have two continents colliding you could see here that there used to be subduction because there's old oceanic crust right here but that ocean has completely closed so now we have continent meeting continent and it can't subduct anymore so it starts to crumble upwards and this is what's happening at the himalayas here you can see we have the india the continent of india is colliding with asia and that collision is causing those extreme mountain ranges that we see here in the himalayas and actually the himalayas because that collision is still taking place the himalayas are still getting taller today so we haven't even reached their peak now why has ocean sediment been found in the himalayas if this is a continent versus continent there's no ocean here at the himalayas but we find ocean sediment here well that is because there used to be an ocean there used to be an ocean that separated india and asia but there was subduction going on and that subduction destroyed all of that ocean plain and brought india and china together it closed the ocean and when those continents collided we got some ocean sediment that got trapped in between and pushed upwards and that's why we see ocean sediment in the himalayas so there used to be an ancient ocean between the two continents i think that's really really cool so the reason why there's ocean sediment in the himalayas is because there used to be an ocean and it was closed due to the motion of the plates and this caused the sediment that used to be in between india and asia to become trapped when the continents finally did collide so looking at rocks and and looking at the features that our planet has can tell us a whole lot about earth's history so here's just showing a photo of the himalayas a great example of a continental collision continent versus continental collision himalayas massive mountain ranges still getting taller today now you might notice i'll go back to this diagram that with this type of boundary we don't get volcanoes volcanoes are only associated with the convergent boundaries that have subduction remember only oceanic plates can subduct so when it's continent versus continent we don't get subduction so we don't get that partial melting and we don't get volcanoes however we can still get earthquakes because they're colliding and it's not a smooth process that is just going upwards and upwards and upwards things are getting stuck and crumpled and coming apart and we do get some pretty large earthquakes here and there were even some pretty big ones not so far in the past in the himalayas that caused lots of landslides and destruction and a lot of the towns along himalaya especially nepal so even though we don't have volcanoes as a hazard here we still have a very hazardous location here with our earthquakes and because we have such tall mountain ranges those earthquakes can produce landslides so landslides are a big hazard associated with this as well all right so here's just a summary of those convergent boundaries and i think this is a good slide again i showed it in the beginning but kind of summarizes exactly what we talked about now convergent boundaries are the most complex so don't feel bad if you're getting kind of confused and you might have to review this boundary a little bit more than the others but convergent plate boundaries occur because two tectonic plates are moving together or converging and they're colliding and we find lots of different features here at convergent plate boundaries like subduction zones now subduction zones only occur when there's oceanic crust involved so subduction zones can be found when we have oceanic crust colliding with other oceanic crust remember the denser older one will subduct and we also get subduction zones when oceanic crust is meeting continental crust and the oceanic crust and ducks underneath and what happens at subduction zones volcanoes so we get volcanoes at subduction zones now convergent plate boundaries we can also find folded mountain ranges especially when we have two continents colliding because when we have two continents gliding they can't subduct because they're not dense enough so they will crumple upwards or fold upwards and create these massive folded mountain ranges like the himalayas now no matter the type of convergent boundary we'd get earthquakes but remember volcanoes are only found at subduction zones and there are three different types remember continental versus continental continental versus oceanic and oceanic versus oceanic so make sure you know the difference between the three what types of features that can be found in all three continental versus continent they're gonna be those folded mountain ranges and earthquakes and landslides continental versus oceanic are going to be our volcanic continental arcs where we have volcanic mountain chains on the continental side and also mega thrust earthquakes and tsunami and then oceanic versus oceanic we get subduction we get volcanoes we get volcanic island arcs like japan and we also get mega thrust earthquakes and tsunamis so just make sure you review those before you take the quiz and especially before you take the exam because i think they are the most complex out of the three boundaries but in the next video we are going to explore the third and final type of plate boundary and that's called transform and i will see you at the next video

howdy everyone again and we will be moving on to our final plate tectonic boundary on transform boundaries transform plate boundaries can sometimes also be called a transform fault which you've probably heard of probably more frequently and transform plate boundaries are when plates slide horizontally past one another without producing or creating crust and without destroying crust so nothing is colliding and destroying crust and nothing is being split apart or creating crust instead we are just sliding past one another and these are most commonly occur on the sea floor and they join two spreading centers or two divergent plate boundaries and we call these fracture zones and i'll show some pictures of what that looks like here in a bit transform plate boundaries can actually move ocean ridges towards the subduction zones so that's how we can eventually close an ocean and a few transformed faults cut through continental crust although most of them occur in oceanic but some examples of where this occurs in continental crust would be the san andreas fault and the alpine fault of new zealand all right so here's some images of what transform faults look like and transform plate boundaries again most commonly occur along segments of mid-ocean ridges like this so here let me get my laser pointer again here's a map of the atlantic ocean we have south america here we have africa over here and right in the middle of the atlantic ocean so this mid-atlantic ridge is where we have plates splitting apart creating new crust so this is a big divergent plate boundary injury you'll see that it is fresh see these yellow lines here these are transform faults or transform plate boundaries so here the red lines represent divergence where the plates are splitting apart but depending on the rate of spreading at these specific locations you could have transformed falls that we see here or these fractures in so again the red here is diverging plate boundary or mid ocean ridges and the yellow are the transformed plate boundaries where they're just sliding past one another nothing's being created at this location and again this is where most of our transformed lake boundaries are actually located in the middle of the ocean at these spreading centers so here's another example of the mid-ocean ridge this is the same one we just looked at but this is just in google earth you know how much i love google earth well here's the same look closely that divergent plate boundary is fractured and those yellow lines are our transform plate boundaries now we also have more transform plate boundaries on the west coast of the united states and we'll talk about the san andreas fault because that's one that occurs in continental crust but before we get to the more famous san andreas fault let's just look at the one that's occurring offshore now we've talked about the cascade mountains where we have that cascade subduction zone where the wanda fuka plate is subducting underneath the north american plate creating all those hazards that we talked about in the last video but if you go further offshore you'll notice that there are divergent plate boundaries we have the juan de fuca ridge where we have new crust bridge is is fractured you see the red line here and if you move up north you'll see that it's displaced all the way to the west and continues on over here well that fracture right here is a transform fault and if you zoom out on the cascadia subduction zone here you can see that there are numerous transformed faults or transform plate boundaries now if you continue to move south along this boundary you'll see there's the more famous san andreas fault that occurs on continental crust and we're going to talk about that next so here's the san andreas fault again the san andreas fault is just a transform boundary so nothing is colliding here and nothing is splitting apart that being said do you think california will fall off the face of the earth like the hollywood movies portray probably not right if you look at the relative plate motion on either side of this andrea's fault you'll see here that the western edge of california and the baja peninsula here will slowly continue to move north relative to the rest of north america so no california is not going to fall off the face of the earth folks but these transformed faults as you might know still produce geologic hazards now they don't produce volcanoes because we don't have any subduction going on here and we don't have any divergence going on here that's going to allow that hot mantle material to rise to the surface so there are no volcanoes with these transform faults however there are earthquakes and you've probably heard about southern california having some pretty big earthquakes in the past now these earthquakes are caused very similarly how the other earthquakes and our convergent plate boundaries are except for instead of things colliding and subducting or just crumpling upwards and getting stuck here we have the plates moving horizontally to each other but again these plates are not smooth right they get stuck as well and what happens when they get stuck you have all that stress and strain building up building up building up and eventually it's gonna get unstuck boom and move suddenly and that's when we get our earthquake so transform plate boundaries can produce pretty large earthquakes as we know about here um in our country in southern california now here's a really cool image of the san andreas fault now what are some features that we see with transform faults now transform faults nothing is splitting apart right so we don't get mid-ocean ridges we don't see volcanoes we don't see mountain chains we don't see rift valleys and nothing's colliding here so we're not seeing any volcanic islands we're not seeing any volcanic mountain chains or folded mountain belts but what happens at these transform boundaries is we're displacing features that were already there and this photo shows a really great example of that here we have a dry creek channel here on to the south of the san andreas fault it's moving north but look what happens as it reaches the san andreas fault it's displaced and moved shortly to the east where it continues on north up here and these transform faults not only can displace rivers they can displace mountain chains and they can even displace things that we make like roads and fence lines things like that can be displaced slowly over time so it's really important to pay attention whenever you're choosing a place to live or building a structure to make sure you're not building anything on top of a transform plate boundary because they are moving and they will continue to move all right so a little summary about transform boundaries transform boundaries are a tectonic boundary where two tectonic plates slide past one another again no crust is being created and no crust is being destroyed here we are just sliding past one another they occur most commonly along segments of the mid-ocean ridge and if you look on google earth along all of the mid-ocean ridges in the atlantic the pacific and the indian you'll see that they're heavily fractured and displaced and those fractures are transformed faults or transform plate boundaries but we do have some transformed faults that occur on continental crust the most famous example is that san andreas fault zone in southern california now hazards here include earthquakes but there are no volcanoes associated with these type of boundaries now although earth's total surface area does not change the size and shape of individual plates are constantly changing because plate boundaries are changing through time they migrate some plate boundaries end up getting created whenever we start having that rifting happening like what's happening in east africa we're going to eventually create a new ocean creating new plate boundaries and plate boundaries can be destroyed eventually you could have things being subducted like that wanda fuca plate's eventually going to be completely subducted and we're going to eventually subduct a ridge possibly now the breakup of pangaea is a great example of that because during the breakup of pangaea there was no atlantic ocean that's how the atlantic ocean was formed it was formed when pangaea broke apart and india collided with asia to form the himalayas they weren't there before just like the appalachian mountains that was due to a continental collision that happened long time ago so these plate boundaries are not constant they're constantly changing they're being created they're being destroyed and we can expect these geologic processes to continue throughout earth's future so here's showing that breakup of pangaea you'll see here it begins to split apart this is when our atlantic ocean is being born and of course it's a slow process remember these plates are moving about the rate of your fingernails so this takes millions of years the atlantic ocean gets larger the continents keep spreading apart spreading apart spreading apart to where they are today now what will plate tectonics look like in the future well geologists use the present plate motions to try to extrapolate plate movements into the future so the baja and southern california we saw will eventually slide past the north american plate changing the shape of that continent and africa is going to continue to collide with eurasia so a little summary on all of the plate tectonics in general plates can all be continental lithosphere they can be all oceanic with a sphere or some plates can have some part lotion lithosphere and some part continental lithosphere now remember the continental lithosphere is thicker but the most important part about the continental atmosphere is that it's less dense so it doesn't really matter that it's thicker the oceanic lithosphere is thinner but remember it's more dense and that's the important property about that and because of that only oceanic lithosphere can normally be subducted a new ocean lithosphere is created at mid-ocean ridges or divergent plate boundaries ocean lithosphere then is destroyed at subduction zones or convergent plate boundaries and all of these plate boundaries are major locations for earthquakes but it's only convergent and divergent that have volcanoes in the next video we will begin testing the theory of plate tectonics with ocean drilling paleomagnetism hot spots and mantle plume so we're not finished with this module

howdy again everyone we are going to continue on in module 2 talking about the testing the model of plate tectonics with ocean drilling and paleomagnetism so you're probably aware that the earth has a magnetic field and this magnetic field has invisible lines of force that pass through the planet and extend from one magnetic pole to the other out into space creating the shield around the earth that we know as the magnetosphere today the magnetic poles are roughly aligned with the geographic poles where the earth's rotational axis intersects the surface earth's magnetic field is a little less obvious to us than the gravitational field and that's because we can't feel the magnetic field however the movement of a compass needle confirms its presence a traditional compass needle is usually just a small magnet that's free to rotate on an axis and it becomes aligned with those magnetic lines of force when it's laid flat one end of the compass will point to magnetic north while the other end of the compass points to magnetic south now the magnetic poles can move over time though but they usually stay in the vicinity of the north and south geographic poles here is a map that shows how the magnetic poles have moved over human time scales and let me get my laser pointer going this red line represents the motion of that magnetic pull through time you can think of it as where the bar magnet is intercepting the surface so it does slightly move over time but for the most part it's staying within the vicinity of the geographic pool now earth's magnetic field has two main components we call it declination and inclination declination is the difference between where magnetic north is and the geographic true north and inclination is the tilt of a compass needle from the horizontal the geographic north is the center of rotation again remember it's where that rotational axis intersects the surface of the earth that's what we consider the geographic north and that's usually different than the true magnetic north however they are in close vicinity of each other that declination is going to be the difference between those two and that can change over time and the compass is pointing to magnetic north it does not point to the true geographic north so when you have your compass it is pointing to where that bar magnet you can think of within the earth is actually pointing to now some naturally occurring minerals are magnetic and those minerals can be influenced by earth's magnetic field one of the most common is the iron rich mineral called magnetite which is abundant in lava flows of basaltic composition remember our oceanic crust is predominantly basalt in nature so we have a ton of this iron-rich minerals located in the oceanic crust now basaltic lavas erupt at surface temperatures greater than 1800 degrees fahrenheit which exceed a threshold temperature for magnetism which is known as the curie point now the magnetite grains and the molten lava are non-magnetic but as the lava cools these iron-rich grains become magnetized and they then align themselves in the direction of the existing magnetic lines of force just like a compass needle once the mineral solidifies though that magnetism usually remains somewhat frozen in place and it preserves the position of earth's magnetic field at the time it crystallized so these rocks that form thousands or even sometimes millions of years ago may actually contain a record of the direction of the magnetic poles at the time of their formation and they're able to tell us the latitude and the longitude in which the rock first formed this study of fossil magnetism to understand the earth's history is called paleomagnetism now studies of paleomagnetism revealed that during the past 500 million years the magnetic pole had gradually wandered from its location from near hawaii northeastward to its present location over the arctic ocean that's pretty strange this was strong evidence that either the magnetic north pole had migrated an idea known as polar wandering or that the poles had remained roughly in place and it was the continents that had drifted beneath them if you just look at that magnetic alignment of the iron-rich minerals in the lava flows which is shown here in this figure it would indicate that the paleomagnetic folds change dramatically through time take a look at that even though the magnetic pool is known to move like we just saw a few slides ago the positions of the magnetic full still correspond pretty closely to the geographic poles therefore the most acceptable explanation was already provided by good old wegner's hypothesis of continental drift further evidence for continental drift came shortly after this discovery when polar wandering path was constructed for north america as seen here for the first 200 million years or so the paths for north america and europe were found to be in similar direction but they are separated by about 3 000 miles then during the middle of the mesozoic era which was about 180 million years ago they began to converge on to the present north pole the explanation for these curves is that north america and europe were joined at one point until the mesozoic and that's when the atlantic began to open and pangaea began to break apart now some of the most convincing evidence for sea floor spreading actually came from the deep sea drilling project which operated from 1966 to 1983. one of the early goals of the project was to gather samples of the ocean floor to establish its age using a drilling ship that was capable of working in thousands of meters deep of water they drilled hundreds of holes through layers of sediment that covered the oceanic crust and they even were able to drill well into the basaltic rock below now these researchers were then able to record the age of the sediment samples from each site that they drilled and they noted each sample's distance away from that mid-ocean ridge and they found that the sediments increased in age with an increase in distance from the ridge this of course supported harry hess and a sea floor spreading hypothesis now the deep sea drilling project was crucial in understanding our planet and the geologic processes that we know now today exist but did you know that it has a long continued history and is even located on campus today the deep sea drilling project ended in 1983 but then it became known as the ocean drilling program or odp and that existed from 1983 to 2003. then in 2003 it became the integrated ocean drilling program until 2013 when it became what we now know it as today as the international ocean discovery program this wonderful organization is actually located here on our campus and it has tons of cores and samples from various projects over the past several decades i have even been using their data on my research on underwater landslides i highly recommend if you ever get a chance to check this facility out now oceanographers also began running their own surveys of the ocean floor during their efforts to make detailed maps of the sea floor topography or sometimes we just call it the symmetry these surveys were accomplished by towing very sensitive instruments called magnetometers magnetometers that measured the strength of the earth's magnetic field recorded in the rocks below it these oceanographers found that the magnetism varied perpendicular to the mid-ocean ridges and that anomalies existed in linear belts parallel to the ridges shown here this relatively simple pattern of magnetic variation you could see the pattern the colors repeat on either side of the ridge further supported the concept of that c4 spreading the stripes of high intensity magnetism are regions where the paleomagnetism of the ocean crust exhibits normal clarity and the low intensity strips are regions where the ocean crust is polarized in the reverse direction this brings us to our next topic of magnetic pole reversals geophysicists discovered that over periods of hundred or thousands of years earth's magnetic field periodically reversed polarity normal polarity is when the north geographic pole and the north magnetic pool coincide like today reverse polarity is when the north geographic pool and the south magnetic pole coincide you can kind of think of it as the bar magnet being flipped upside down inside the earth now how do how do these parallel strips that oceanographers discover become distributed across the ocean floor well remember as the lava magma solidify at the crest of the ridge it is magnetized with the polarity of the earth's magnetic field at the time it was formed because of sea floor spreading this strip of magnetized crust would gradually increase in width until of course the next reversal takes place and here's a cool graphic that illustrates that exact process your textbook also goes into more detail to help better explain this super interesting topic but in our next video we're going to explore testing the model

howdy again everyone and we are going to continue on testing our model of plate tectonics but this time we're going to explore testing it with something called hot spots and mantle plumes mantle plumes are relatively stationary upwelling of mantle material that produce intraplate volcanoes this means that some volcanoes exist on earth that are completely unrelated to plate boundaries now most volcanoes are associated with those convergent subduction zones or those divergent plate boundaries but here we're just going to talk about those intraplate volcanoes called hot spots and this is kind of just a brief overview of hot spots we're going to talk about these in more detail when we get to the volcanoes module but here we're just going to explore how geologists and scientists use hot spots as evidence of plate tectonics so where this mantle plume meets the surface that's what we call a hot spot and yellowstone and hawaii are two examples of hot spots that are formed by these mantle plants as the plate moves over a hot spot a chain of volcanoes known as a hot spot track forms now geologists use hot spot tracks to infer plate motions of the past because the age of each volcano indicates how much time has elapsed since it was over the mantle plume now what do i mean by a hot spot track well hot spots are stationary let me let me stop sharing my screen real quick okay can you see me alright so what i mean by a hotspot track well we can just infer that this piece of paper is a tectonic plate and my red marker here is the hot spot now a hot spot or a mantle plume the mantle plume is stationary it does not move with the continental plates or the oceanic plates it is stationary the plates move above it so here we have our plate and we have the hot spot can you see it start bleeding through the paper here's our hot spot now the plate is going to move but the hot spot is going to stay stationary so what happens when i move this plate moving the plate upwards and that mantle plume appears to be moving downwards but it's not moving at all it's the plate that's moving and it forms this track and that's exactly what's happening on the earth we are forming a track of volcanoes now you know the the islands of hawaii how they form a chain that's because the pacific plate is moving over a stationary mantle plume creating the chain of the hawaiian islands alright so let me go ahead and share my screen again so here's another diagram that shows that if you didn't like the paper in the marker kind of um illustration so here let me see if i can get my laser pointer here you can see that hot mantel plume which is coming from the mantle and the core boundary it's just heat rising up producing melting and produces volcanic activity so here's our big island of hawaii if you didn't know hawaii is a very active volcanic island but hawaii has many islands to it there's maui malokai oahu and all of these chains used to be over the hot spot but of course that pacific plate is moving over that stationary mantle plume and here on the left you can see that illustrated again very nicely so here we have our active volcano but the plate is moving so there's our old active volcano it's now a dead volcano but we have a new active volcano and it's going to the plate is going to keep moving so eventually we're going to create another new volcano now notice these old dead volcanoes here are getting smaller and smaller and that's because over time they're getting eroded so they used to be very big volcanoes but it's been some time and they've eroded downwards and you can see that with the the big island of hawaii it's the biggest island it's near the active mantle plume so we still have volcanism going on that's still building the island but as you move away from hawaii the islands start to get smaller and smaller and that's exactly why it's just because a lot of time has passed and those islands have been eroded and weathered away now they were probably just as big as the big island hawaii at some point so here's another map of the hawaiian islands now if you notice here the ages of the hawaiian islands are indicated on this map here we have the big island of hawaii is only 0.7 million years old the low heat under sea volcano right here this is actually where the current mantle flew sits so it's barely barely sticking out of the sea but the big island of white the mantle plume began here 0.7 million years ago but if you continue on through the chain you see maui is 1.3 million years old malakai is 1.8 million years old oahu 3.3 million years old kauai 5.6 million years so you get the point the important part to note here is that the ages of the hawaiian islands are decreasing towards the big island now why is that that's because that mantle plume is stationary and the pacific plate is moving over top of it now let's zoom out and take a look at these hawaiian islands here's that big island of white this is the the zoomed in map that we just saw why but hawaii is a much larger chain than you might realize we have the hawaiian ridge where these are old islands they are now submerged into the sea so they don't stick out anymore but if you map the sea floor you can see these remnants of old islands dating all the way back to 30 million years ago and if you notice it even changes direction the emperor sea mounds 50 million years old here all the way up to almost the aleutian trench 80 million years old so what does this tell us well this can actually tell us a whole lot of information well for one we can see the direction of the plate so we know that the pacific plate is moving in this direction right now which corresponds nicely with the hawaiian ridge and the the hawaiian island chains but you could see right around 40 million years or so that it appears that the plate has changed direction entirely and that's exactly what happened the plate did change direction at about that time and you can see that preserved very nicely on the sea floor with these old islands that used to be on top of that mantle plane that still sits stationary over here now another cool thing that you can do using these hot spots not only is this evidence that supports plate tectonics because you can clearly see the track being preserved as the plates moving and you can see the direction that the plate is moving in and how it's changed through time but you can even calculate how fast the plate has moved and how it has changed through time now how can we do that well a velocity is usually given in distance over time meters per second miles per hour feet per minute it's always going to be a distance over time well the cool thing about hot spots is we can calculate their age we can we can figure out how old they are so for example we know that the kawhi here is 5 million years old and this sea amount over here is 10 million years old well what's the time it's 5 million years that's the distance that's the difference in time between them so 5 million years have passed between where the hot spot was over kawhi and when the hot spot was over this c mount over here so that's our our time in our velocity calculation now what is our distance well we can just measure the distance between the two i don't know exactly what the distance is but you would calculate 5 million years divided by the distance between those two points and you would get a rate and it would probably be in centimeters per year because remember our tectonic plates are moving at about the same rate as our fingernails in the centimeters per year but we can calculate all along this segment how quickly the plate was moving and if it slowed down or sped up through time so these hot spots are really useful to us and we can get a whole lot about earth's history just by looking at them all right so here's one more cross section showing that hawaiian hot spot in the mansion plume again here's the mantha plume remember the lohi sea mount that's where the mantle plume is currently sitting under and eventually will form a new big island here's the big island of hawaii we have kilauea mauna loa those are our active volcanoes and then you could see that this mantle plume remember it is stationary it does not move with the plates but the plates are continuously moving on top of it so our pacific plate is moving towards the northwest here and that's how you can see these old remnants of the volcanic islands that were left behind really cool stuff hopefully you think so too again we're going to get into a little bit more detail and and kind of revisit this topic when we get into the volcanoes module now we don't just have hot spots in the ocean we can even have hot spots over continental crust so here's just one example yellowstone is a mantle plume underneath the continental crust of north american plate so same processes occur here but instead of islands we get calderas which is just a depression that happens after the volcano erupts so here you can see that there are several calderas that have been left imprinted in our country so here we have yellowstone yellowstone the caldera of yellowstone park sits inside of the caldera is 0.6 million years old that's when the last eruption occurred was 0.6 million years now if you look you can find another caldera and it is 1.2 million years so 0.6 million years have passed between those eruptions now there's another one at 4 million years we had another eruption we had another eruption at six million years another one at 10 and so forth so you get the idea but this this works the same way as that island chains of hawaii work these are hot spot tracks just over continents instead of in the ocean now one cool fact is the last eruption was 0.6 million years ago or 600 000 years ago and then the last eruption before that was 1.2 million years ago so how much time has passed between those 0.6 million years so you could say that we are due for a super volcano eruption in yellowstone of course it is much harder to predict and it's not exactly consistent through time because you have almost three million years between that eruption and this eruption and you have two million years between that and the next and so forth so you see it becomes very hard to predict when that next eruption could occur but it will occur because yellowstone is still above an active mantle plane all right so here's just a map showing of all the hot spots on earth that we know about now again hot spots do not occur at plate boundaries you can see the plate boundaries in this map now there are some hot spots that occur at the boundary like iceland that we kind of looked at a little bit um but that is just a coincidence we don't really understand why iceland is on a divergent plate boundary and a hot spot um but hot spots they usually don't occur at plate boundaries they don't have to um they are thought to be caused by those hot mantle plumes and those hot spots remain stationary for very long periods of time remember we saw that hawaiian island chains and the emperor seamount chain was at least 50 million years old so we know that the the hot spot had to have been there for at least 50 million years so these hot spots stay there for quite a long time now hot spots are a way scientists can infer past plate motion today though we use satellite technology called the global positioning system which you might have heard over use very often gps we use this gps to track the current motions of the plate but these hot spots are very useful for us to figure out the the past plate motion now in the next and final video of this module we will look at the drivers of all this plate motion hang tight guys you're almost done with module 2.

howdy everyone and welcome to the last video of module two now this video is going to be a short one even though we're describing what drives plate motion so you think that it would be a fairly long video however as you'll soon learn geologists still don't quite agree on what exactly the the driving motion of our planet is being caused by but we'll explore some models so what drives the plates motions geologists have discovered that the lithospheric plates are part of the larger convection system that produces the plate motion now convection is the way heat transfers through liquids and gases it quite simply implies that hot things will rise while cool things will sink now convection works because cold material is denser than the same material when it's heated up this earth's internal convection which is a little more complex than just a pot of boiling water has two main forces that are driving the plate motion we have a slab pole and ridge push geologists agree that the subduction of cold dense slabs of oceanic lithosphere is the major driving force of plate motion slab pole occurs because these cold slabs of oceanic lithosphere is denser than the underlying warm asthenosphere and they sink kind of like a ship's anchor would sink when you throw it out into the water the slabs are being pulled down by the mantle or into the mantle by gravity now another important driving force however not as significant as slab pool is ridge push and this occurs along mid-ocean ridges at mid-ocean ridges this is where we have that newly formed oceanic lithosphere that's being pushed away and this gravity-driven mechanism that's what we call the ridge push and it's resulted from the elevated position of the oceanic ridges which causes those new slabs of lithosphere to kind of slide down both flanks of the rich just like how gravity pulls down snow during an avalanche now here's a figure showing both of those driving forces in action and again let me get my little laser pointer so here we have slab pole being illustrated slab pull results from that sinking of the cold dense slab of oceanic lithosphere and this is the major driving force of plate motion because gravity just like an anchor when you throw it overboard is gonna gravity's gonna sink it and it's gonna sink it pretty fast as it moves down so that's what's pulling the plates that slab pole again that's the major driving force over here we have ridge push being illustrated and ridge push is a gravity driven force that results from just the elevated position of the ridge so we have new lithosphere being formed right here and it's hot so it's it's elevated and gravity is going to cause it to sink down as it's being pushed away so we have a little bit of a pushing motion happening at those mid-ocean ridges but the main force is that pull that's going on at that subduction zone although not fully understood researchers agree that plate tectonics and convection flow in the mantle are part of the same system now remember plate tectonics is still a relatively new theory it wasn't established until the 1960s which if you think about it your parents may have been alive then or definitely your grandparents weren't so we are still learning more about these processes today now plate tectonics and convection flow in the mantle are part of that same system remember we have that slab pole in the ridge push and we agree that the energy source for plate tectonics is earth's internal heat so as a result many models have been proposed although we're going to examine just one type so in this model the whole mantle model which is often referred to as the plume model you can see here that there are sinking slabs of cold oceanic lithosphere and it coincides with the downward limbs or those downward yellow arrows that you see of the convection cells while you can also see that rising mantle plumes right here are carrying hot material from that core mantle boundary towards the earth's surface so this also helps explain the hot spots that we just talked about in the last video however you all need to keep in mind that geologists still continue to debate the nature of this plate mantle flow and as they continue to investigate the possibilities eventually a widely accepted hypothesis will emerge all right i told you this video would be short and that's it for plate tectonics that is a big topic you should all pat yourselves on the back for making it this far you should now have all the information you need to complete the participation activity i highly recommend that you review over chapter 2 in your textbook especially those sections 2.4 to 2.6 before you take the quiz and of course please reach out if you have any questions at all on this material this certainly is a busy week for you all you even have one more module to go after this i will see you in module 3 where we will learn about earth's materials and eventually this will shut off

howdy everyone and welcome to module three the last module of this week this module will be talking about matter and minerals so what makes up the material of the earth and to do that we're going to start with a lecture video on why study minerals in the first place and really what we're going to spend time on this video is doing a chemistry review all right so i showed this slide in the first module but it really matters to show this again when we're talking about minerals because remember every american born will need 3.5 million pounds of minerals metals and fuels in a lifetime now most of these minerals are coming from mineral ores which is any mineral that contains a valuable metal that can be economically viable to mine so why is it important to study minerals well this image shows it exactly here we rely heavily on minerals in our everyday life now here's just a quick example of how much we really do rely on minerals let's just take your kitchen for example now there are so many minerals that are involved in creating the things that you use every day in your kitchen for example the electrical wiring in your kitchen or really your whole home or apartment includes copper aluminum and even petroleum products now your microwave contains copper gold iron nickel and silica your stove uses aluminum copper iron nickel and silica your refrigerator uses aluminum copper iron nickel petroleum products and even zinc now table salt that you probably put in most of your food is made out of a mineral called halite and most salt has i added iodine which we get from minerals as well now even the plates and dishes that you use include clay silica and feldspar minerals the silverware you use contains iron nickel silver and chromium sometimes even your stainless steel sink is made up of iron and nickel so nearly everything we use and even consume contains minerals that need to be mined now we just talked about all the different things we can find in the kitchen but even things like a mcdonald's milkshake contains minerals who knew things like makeup and eye shadow hard rubber materials and cell phone and car batteries all rely on minerals nearly everything we use comes from minerals in some way or another all right so what exactly is a mineral in the first place well minerals are the building blocks of rocks and a mineral has a definition with five characteristics in order to be classified as a mineral it must be naturally occurring it must be generally inorganic so nothing organic is going to be considered a mineral and a mineral must have an orderly crystalline structure and be solid so no liquids no gases and finally a mineral has to have a definite chemical composition that could allow for some variation what do i mean by chemical composition i mean that every mineral has its own chemical formula for example a very common mineral on earth's crust called quartz has a chemical formula of sio2 that means there's one silica atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and then minerals are the building blocks of rocks and we kind of talked about rocks in the first module where a rock is a solid mass of minerals or mineral-like matter that occurs naturally and of course the earth is made up of rocks and rocks are made up of minerals so it's important that we spend some time or at least a module in talking about these minerals because they make up our entire earth so if minerals makes rocks what makes minerals atoms atoms are the building blocks of minerals and atoms are the smallest particles of matter that cannot be chemically split they are composed of a nucleus that contains protons which are positively charged and neutrons which are neutral or have no electrical charge and this nucleus is surrounded by electrons which have a negative charge now all of this might be review because you've probably taken chemistry in high school or maybe another class on campus so i'm just going to briefly reintroduce a little bit of chemistry because it's important to understand how atoms work in order to understand how minerals are made and then of course rocks in the rest of the earth but i highly recommend that you read your textbook especially on these sections if you need a more in-depth review now electrons exist as a cloud of negative charges that surround the nucleus that has the positively charged protons in the neutral neutrons and these electrons are moving about the nucleus in regions called principal shells and the outermost shell contains something that we call valence electrons and these valence electrons are interacting with other atoms to form chemical bonds now there are many different models of an atom we have the easy to understand or easier to understand models of the spatial shell model that have electrons that are fixed on a spherical surface around the nucleus and we have the planetary orbit model that have electrons orbiting around the nucleus and then we have more complex models like the electroneum model and the probability models which are interpretations of the solutions of the schrodinger's equation as wave functions and eigen energies now don't worry you don't need to know all that but what you should know is that the probability model is the most accurate model of an atom and that's because the atomic orbital is shown as a region with an atom that encloses and that's where the electron is likely to be 90 of the time because in reality electrons are not orbiting nicely like you see in the spatial shell in the planetary orbit model rather these electrons are very chaotic and bounce around in a non-predictable way and that's why our probability model is the most accurate model that we know of of the atom now when we talk about atoms we should talk about what an atomic number is because i'm going to show you here soon the periodic table of elements and if you remember from chemistry class elements have an atomic number the atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom and it determines the atom's chemical nature and it's important to remember that that the atom determines the atomic chemical nature the number of protons all right so i am going to introduce the table of elements here soon so what is an element an element is a group of the same kind of atoms and approximately there are 90 natural elements and then there are several others that have been synthesized in a laboratory now these elements are organized in the periodic table which again i'm going to show here shortly and they're organized in this table so that those with similar properties line up into groups and it's really useful so there's a reason this table has the funky shape it has now most elements join with other elements to form chemical compounds an example of a chemical compound would be something as simple as table salt which is made up of a mineral called halite halite is sodium and chloride bonded together that's a chemical compound nacl sodium chloride all right so here's that periodic table of elements now here in the periodic table of elements you could see that each element has a number and the number on top that's the atomic number remember the atomic number tell us how many protons are in that atom so let's just use carbon as an example do you see carbon carbon has number six it's on the right hand side of the periodic table now carbon's atomic number is six that means it has six protons now let's talk about noble gases noble gases can easily be found on the periodic table it is the last column on the right hand side noble gases are inert that means they are chemically inactive and that is because their outer shell is full of electrons so they tend to not have a tendency to want to gain or lose those electrons because they're already stable now all the rest of the elements are considered unstable and they're ready to react and that is because their outer shell is not full of electrons at least not yet they have room to gain or lose electrons in most atoms they want to become stable like those noble gases they want their outer shell to be full so in order to achieve this they will lose or gain electrons now a general rule of thumb is that most atoms want to be surrounded by eight valence electrons to be considered full so the periodic table has roman numerals above each column and these roman numerals represent the number of valence electrons that particular column of elements have for example elements in the first column you'll see has the roman numeral one see how it has one a above that first column this means that the elements in this column have one valence electron so those elements are more likely to lose that one electron than they are to gain seven electrons and the second column elements has the roman numeral two above it and these elements have two valence electrons so those elements are more likely to lose two electrons than they are to gain six more so all the elements on the left side of the table have a tendency to lose electrons now again if you notice the noble gases the noble gases have a roman numeral eight above their column that is because they already have eight electrons in their outer shell which makes them stable which makes them inert the column to the left of the noble gases has a roman numeral 7 above it this means these elements have 7 valence electrons so they are more likely to gain one electron than they are to lose all seven the next one to the left of that has a roman numeral six this means these elements have six valence electrons so they are more likely to gain two electrons than they are to lose those six electrons so the elements on the right side of the table have a tendency to gain electrons under normal conditions found on earth most elements form bonds with atoms of other elements with the exception of those noble gases that do not like to bond because they are already stable a chemical bond is a transfer or sharing of electrons that allows each atom to attain a full valence shell of electrons remember valence is just a fancy word for the outer shell some atoms bond to form ionic compounds some form molecules and some form metallic substances here is another useful way to imagine the valence shell of an atom remember the octet rule in most atoms want eight electrons so you can see the column seven like the element chlorine see where the roman numeral seven is the second column to the left chlorine is represented by cl if you take a look at that element chlorine it is only missing one electron to be considered full so this element would be most likely to bond to an element with one electron because it needs one electron now an element that has one electron is sodium which is in that first column underneath roman numeral one and sodium is represented by n a you see n a has one electron so this sodium is more than happy to get rid of its electron to the chlorine to become more stable this process is a type of bonding called ionic bonding to produce a solid ionic compound of sodium chloride which again is that mineral called halite or you probably know it better as table salt now in ionic bonding atoms gain or lose outermost valence electrons to form ions and ions are just positively or negatively charged atoms it is an atom that has gained or lost one or more electrons ionic compounds consist of an orderly arrangement of oppositely charged ions so an ionic bond is the attraction of oppositely charged ions to one another again an example would be halite the table salt sodium chloride so here is a better illustration showing how that ionic bonding is working in halite remember halite is sodium chloride one sodium atom bonded to one chlorine atom you see here sodium has 11 protons and if we went back to the table of elements you would see that sodium has an atomic number of 11 so it has 11 protons and it also has 11 electrons and it gives away an electron to the chlorine so then it becomes positively charged because it still has 11 protons but now it only has 10 electrons so it has a plus 1 charge now chlorine has 17 protons because its atomic number is 17. and it also has 17 electrons it is given an electron from the sodium so it becomes negatively charged because now it has 18 electrons but still only has 17 protons giving it a negative one charge now both of these atoms have opposite charges so they are electrostatically attracted to each other creating that ionic bond now covalent bonds are much stronger than the ionic bonds covalent bonds are when a pair of atoms share one or more valence electrons between them instead of gaining or losing it completely a great example of this is the hydrogen molecule which is made up of two hydrogen atoms here you can see the two hydrogen atoms combined to form a hydrogen molecule hydrogen is one of those exceptions of the octet rule because it only contains a single shell which becomes full with only two electrons instead of eight so imagine two hydrogen atoms which each contain one proton and one electron approaching each other once they meet the electron configuration changes so that both electrons primarily occupy the space between the atoms in other words the two electrons are shared by both hydrogen atoms in this situation they do not form ions instead these forces that hold the atoms together arises from the attraction of oppositely charged particles the positively charged protons in the nuclei and the negatively charged electrons that surround it so what is the difference between ionic and covalent bonds again remember ionic bonds are electrostatically attracted while covalent bonds are sharing electrons now a few minerals such as native gold silver and copper are made entirely of metal atoms packed tightly together in an orderly way the bonding that holds these atoms together results from each atom contributing its valence electrons to a common pole of electrons which are free to move throughout the entire metallic structure this is why metals have high electrical conductivity and it's why they tend to be malleable and ductile while ionic and covalent bonded minerals are more brittle to visualize this difference picture dropping a ceramic plate on the floor versus dropping a metal spoon on the floor again how do electrons behave in a mineral with metallic bonding the electrons move relatively easily from atom to atom then we also have hybrid bonds that exhibit some degree of electron sharing and some degree of electron transfer silicate minerals which we will talk about later are composed of these hybrid bonds now here's a figure showing that metallic bonding a little bit easier you can see here the central core of each metallic atom has an overall positive charge and consists of the nucleus and inner electrons however within this structure there is a c you can think of it as of negatively charged outer electrons and there are free to move throughout the entire structure and surround those positive ions again this is what makes it have a high electrical conductivity and makes metals very malleable all right so that's our review on chemistry we are now going to move into more on what makes a mineral a mineral and the different properties of a mineral however if you're still a little confused about the chemistry i highly recommend that you review those sections in your textbook

howdy again everyone we are going to be continuing on module 3. i apologize if the first video was a little bit too chemistry heavy but i did warn you at the beginning of the semester that geology was a very interdisciplinary science that includes chemistry physics and biology so this module on minerals is going to be a little bit chemistry heavy but i can assure you the rest of the semester is not going to contain as much chemistry as this module all right so continuing on what exactly is a mineral now again beginning our study of geology requires the understanding of some of earth's building blocks and we kind of begin with minerals which we've already learned make up the rocks of the earth's crust and interior now minerals are important components of soil plants and even the human body which we haven't talked about there are over 4 000 minerals but only about 20 minerals commonly make up most of the rocks on earth now minerals as you'll soon see are grouped by chemical composition and the arrangement of the atoms that make up the minerals internal crystal structure and minerals are classified by their chemical composition into about nine mineral groups but for the purpose of this class we're really only going to categorize them into two main big groups now the chemical composition and atomic arrangement of a mineral determines its physical properties okay so just to review we've already talked about this in the last video but as a refresher what is a mineral well remember a mineral has to have these five characteristics it has to be naturally occurring inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and an orderly internal atomic structure which means the atoms are bonded together and arranged in a repeating three-dimensional pattern that forms almost like a skeleton which we call a crystal lattice now these last two characteristics the chemical composition and the atomic structure that is what determines a mineral's appearance and their physical properties so based on the definition of a mineral is ice mineral well it's naturally occurring it's inorganic it's solid under certain temperatures it has a definite chemical composition h2o two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom and it has an orderly internal arrangement seen here so yes ice is indeed a mineral now let's continue this exercise would a lab-grown diamond be considered a mineral no that's because it's not naturally occurring now diamonds that we mined out of the ground are minerals because they are naturally occurring now is glass a mineral no that's because glass doesn't actually have a crystalline structure now would oil be considered a mineral no oil isn't a mineral either and that's because it's a liquid and mineral has to be a solid now what about gypsum maybe you've never even heard of gypsum oh yes gypsum is a mineral it's naturally incurring an organic solid with a definite chemical composition in an orderly internal arrangement all right so what are the physical properties of a mineral there are lots of properties of minerals and here are the main ones that geologists use to identify minerals from each other we have color streak hardness cleavage fracture luster crystal form specific gravity and then there are various other special properties like does it react acid is it magnetic does it smell funky even does it have a particular taste these are all different properties that we use to identify minerals and i'm going to talk about each of these properties here in more detail so let's start out with color now color is the most obvious right but it's actually the most misleading way to identify a mineral and that's because minerals can occur in many different colors the different colors are actually a result from impurities or they can actually change colors under various circumstances like changing temperature and pressure so color although it's obvious is not the best way to identify a mineral now streak is a color that you can rely on a little bit more streak is the color of a powdered mineral so when we pulverize the mineral into a powder the color of that powder is actually much more useful than the outward appearance of that mineral now the powdered mineral will always be the same regardless of the outward color appearance here i have my favorite example on the left you see a silver shiny mineral this is called hematite and on the right you see a very dull earthy red mineral this is also hematite look at these two mineral samples they're the same exact mineral but they look completely different and that's why we can't rely on the outward color of a mineral to define it however in the center of this image i have a streak plate which is usually a ceramic plate and if you take the lab portion of this class you're going to experiment with this but if i polarize the mineral onto the streak plate and observe the color of the powder that's left behind you will notice that they both have a reddish brown streak regardless of which sample i pulverized again this is why streak is a much more useful property to identify a mineral all right hardness is a really great property that we use and hardness is the resistance of a mineral to scratching and geologists use something called the most scale of hardness which i have pictured here now this is just a relative scale between the values of 1 and 10. there is no equation that you can plug numbers into to actually calculate this kind of a value again this is just a relative scale what do i mean by relative scale i mean that we assign values to this scale so a value of one is assigned to the softest mineral we know which is talc powder is made of talc it's very soft that gets a value of 1. now we assign a value of 10 to the hardest mineral that we know about which is diamond diamond is the hardest mineral on earth that gets a value of 10. so anything in between 1 and 10 just means it's harder than baby powder but it's softer than a diamond now hardness is determined by the strength of the bonds holding the atoms together so the stronger the atomic bonds the harder the mineral is going to be so the hardness is actually a really useful property that's directly related to the atomic strength so why are diamonds so hard in the first place here we're going to explore what exactly makes diamonds so hard well remember the last video we went over when we talked about the different types of atomic bonds diamonds are made up of covalent bonds and if you look at the chemical formula of diamond you'll see that it's just made up of carbon c pretty easy to remember but these carbon atoms are covalently bonded to each other remember covalent bonds is when atoms share electrons to make themselves more stable and strong so here you can see the internal structure of diamond if you were an engineer you'd say this structure looks very stable that's because these carbon atoms are sharing electrons and arranging themselves in a very stable orderly three-dimensional structure which makes diamond very strong so let's look at graphite next if you'll notice graphite's chemical formula is also c carbon graphite and diamond are made up of the same exact material they both are made up of carbon but there are two completely different minerals graphite has the same exact composition as diamond but it is very different because it's very very soft if you didn't know graphite is what makes pencil lead what do we do with pencil lead we smear it on the paper graphite is so soft that it will break off a long paper but it's made up of the same stuff as diamonds which is the hardest material known to man why in the world are they very different well that's because of the atomic bonds here's a structure of graphite you'll see that the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets and these sheets are held together by something called van der waals bonds which we didn't really talk about but van der waals bonds are weak electrical forces that attract neutral molecules to one another so it is a much weaker bond than our covalent bonds van der waals bonds are kind of similar to ionic bonds where it's an electrostatic attraction that's keeping them together so it's much easier to peel these sheets of carbon from each other because they're not sharing electrons like the diamond is now diamonds and graphites are something called polymorphs polymorphs are minerals with identical composition but different crystalline structures thus making them different minerals altogether all right now another property of minerals is something called cleavage and fracture now cleavage and fractured they both describe how a mineral breaks now these are kind of different difficult concepts to understand especially in a lecture kind of format it is much easier to understand these in lab so if you take the lab portion of this class you are going to explore these properties in much greater detail now cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break in preferred directions along planar surfaces and it's determined by the varying strength of bonds within the mineral a mineral with cleavage will always break where the bonds are weakest so minerals with cleavage are predictable and repeatable as they break no matter the scale now a fracture is the tendency of a mineral to break along random irregular surfaces these minerals that do not have cleavage will not break in a predictable repeatable fashion because there is no specific planes of weakness in its internal atomic structure well that's a lot of confusing words right well cleavage and fracture both describe how a mineral breaks when we have cleavage we can predict how the mineral will break because we know in that mineral there are varying strengths of bonds and a mineral will always break where the bond is weakest now with fracture when we break these minerals we can't predict how they're going to break because all of the atomic bonds are relatively the same strength so it's unpredictable on how it's going to break it's going to break very randomly a great example of this is if i took a glass vase and i threw it on the ground in front of you other than being completely terrified you wouldn't be able to predict the sizes and shape that that glass vase is going to break into right but if i was to take a big chunk of salt and throw it on the ground i can predict how that's going to break that's because salt has cleavage it is always going to break into little cubes no matter how small salt breaks it'll always break into little cubes i don't know if you've ever held salt underneath a magnifying glass but you'll see that they are indeed tiny little cubes and that's because salt the atomic bonds within that mineral there is a weak plane there's actually three weak planes that causes it to be acute whereas in glass all of the atomic bonds are relatively the same strength and it's just going to break very randomly so here's an example of cleavage again this is called mica or biotite micas are bonded together in sheets that are kind of electrostatically attracted to each other they're ionic bonds ionic bonds are easier to break so with this type of mineral the weakest plane is going to be in between these sheets you can peel this mineral off literally like paper and i think you actually get to play with this mineral in lab if you take the lab portion of this course but this is an example of having one plane of cleavage example a is showing another example of one plane of cleavage but you can also have minerals that have two planes where there are two planes of weaknesses in the atomic bonds or three planes like salt as an example where it breaks off into cubes because there are three planes of weaknesses in that atomic strength and here's some photos just showing fracture on the left we have concoidal fracture where this mineral is breaking very randomly but in a concaved kind of pattern the mineral on the right is very irregular again we cannot predict how either of these minerals are going to break because all of the atomic bonds within these minerals are relatively the same strength we don't have a weak repeated layer all right luster is another property that geologists use and luster describes the way a mineral reflects off of light now there are many different terms that we use for luster quite simply you can have non-metallic versus metallic which means does the mineral reflect light like a metal or not like a metal an example of metallic would be something on the far right called pyrite now when we're talking about non-metallic minerals there are many different ways that light can be reflected off of its surface we have a silky kind of luster like on the left serpentine we have glassy which is there in the center but we have many different terms that we can describe the way a mineral reflects light we can even have opaque where mineral does not travel through it now if you take the lab portion of this class you're going to explore this property in a much more greater detail but for the purpose of this lecture portion all you need to know is that luster is just the way a mineral reflects light alright here's a really big one guys crystal form crystal form describes the geometric arrangement of crystal faces now when a mineral is free to grow in an unrestricted environment where it doesn't need to compete for space it obtains this beautiful crystal form in the shape of the crystal form is actually reflected in the internal structure of the crystal lattice so how those atoms are bonded together is reflected in the macroscopic form here with the shape of the crystal really cool stuff so why does quartz which i have shown here why does it have that pyramid shape well it is a direct result from the orderly atomic structure it has now specific gravity is another property that we use and in practice we really only use specific gravity to separate heavy minerals which are usually our metallic minerals from light minerals and specific gravity is really just the ratio of a mineral's weight in air to its weight in water so it's a unitless number now the higher the specific gravity the denser that mineral actually is so galena 7.2 is a lot denser than sulfur which would be a 2.1 and really what geologists do with this property is when they're out in the field they're picking up minerals and they're hefting it in their hand and saying oh this feels like a high specific gravity or ah this doesn't feel like a high specific gravity so really just in practice we use it to separate metals from nonmetals all right well there are a ton of other special properties that we could get into some minerals have a funky smell which i have shown here in the top left that yellow mineral sulfur sulfur smells like rotten eggs and below that we have this mineral called magnetite which is magnetic which is an also really cool property you can use to identify something so geologists out in the field sometimes carry magnets with them just to see what rocks end up being magnetic now in the top right i have shown calcite next to a bottle of hydrochloric acid now some minerals like carbonates will react to acid so some geologists will even keep this acid in their pocket and pull it out and pour acid on rocks while they're on a hike to see what reacts and what doesn't that's because calcite is actually quite a common rock for being a non-silicate it's one of the most common non-silicate minerals in our crust and it reacts to acid so it's an easy test to identify it and then on the bottom right there i have shown our halite our wonderful table salt guess what special property table salt has it tastes like salt so some crazy geologists will go on a hike and start licking rocks trying to find this stuff you think i'm kidding but i'm really not so here i have calcite shown again and i just think it's important because it is the most common non-silicate mineral and it does react with hydrochloric acid so it is an easy test to identify it now if you take the lab portion of this class you're probably going to play with hydrochloric acid and identify calcite yourself all right so here i just have shown a couple of minerals i have quartz olivine fluorite calcite and they can all occur in these beautiful crystalline forms here's a couple more native elements that are minerals like copper and gold yes they are both considered minerals again there are over 4 000 minerals but only about 20 of them are common in rocks now with this nearly 4000 minerals we can start categorize them into mineral groups now we have rock forming minerals and we have economic minerals there are only a few dozen of rock forming minerals and the common minerals that make up most of the rocks are found in the earth's crust and these are composed mainly of the eight elements that make up most of the continental crust and i'll show you that here in a moment whereas economic minerals are much less abundant these minerals are used extensively in manufacturing of products though now they're not always mutually exclusive groups for example calcite is an economic mineral and a rock forming mineral so here are the eight most abundant elements in the continental crust the eight elements that make up the vast majority of the rock foreign minerals represent more than 98 of the continental crust by weight and they are oxygen which is almost half silicon iron potassium magnesium sodium calcium and aluminum those are our eight most abundant elements in the continental crust now when we classify minerals we have a collection of specimens that exhibit similar internal structure and chemical composition and we call those mineral species we can even further divide mineral species up into mineral varieties for example there are many varieties of quartz we have smoky quartz which contain trace amounts of aluminum giving it its smoky color and we have amethyst which contains trace amount of iron giving it its color now mineral species are assigned to specific mineral groups and there are technically nine mineral groups but silicates carbonates halides sulfates those are all different mineral classes so here are the different mineral groups we have silicate minerals which are the most abundant of all naturally occurring inorganic compounds and then we have oxides sulfides carbonates sulfates halides and native elements you don't need to memorize all of this right now but for the purpose of this class we're just going to separate everything into two groups silicate versus non-silicate minerals again our silicate minerals are the most common type of minerals there are more than 800 known silicates and they account for more than 90 of the earth's crust silicon and oxygen is what makes up the basic building blocks of silicate minerals now non-silicate minerals are not as common as the silicate and they only make up about eight percent of the earth's crust now non-silicate minerals are still important economically and they include carbonates sulfates and halides and we're going to have two separate videos on silicate and non-silicate minerals later on in this module but our next video we're going to talk about how minerals are formed and the different ways we can destroy them

howdy everyone and welcome to the continuation of module 3. in this video we're going to be talking about how minerals form and what are some of the ways that we can destroy minerals so how do minerals form well minerals form through a wide variety of processes and in general there are three processes that form minerals it is called precipitation crystallization and deposition now precipitation occurs when a solid forms then falls out of solution and some examples of these are evapori deposits such as salt and the crystals that we see inside geodes now crystallization is similar to water freezing except this is when minerals are formed from a melted magma lava solution so an example would be a magma formation and deposition can happen as a result of biological processes such as water drilling organisms can transform dissolved material into mineral matter one example of that is calcium carbonate forming coral reefs so the precipitation of mineral matter or ions occur most commonly when salt water body typically inland bodies of water like for example the great salt lake in utah can form evaporates and when this mineral rich water reaches saturation the ions within it begin to bond forming crystalline solids that we call salts that then settle out of solution some common evaporate deposits include halite remember halite sodium chloride our wonderful table salt this is how table salt is formed through precipitation silvite is another example of an evaporate deposit and it is potassium chloride similar to our halite sodium chloride and then we have gypsum now worldwide we can actually find many extensive evaporate deposits some exceeding hundreds of meters in thickness and these deposits provide evidence that there were ancient seas that have long since evaporated now one great example of that can be seen here in this image this is an image of white sands national park in new mexico and it is direct evidence that there used to be a shallow tropical sea in this region that has long since evaporated forming these beautiful white sands that we now see now minerals can also precipitate from slowly moving groundwater and groundwater can fill fractures or voids and rocks and sediments one great example of this is a geode geodes forming cavities in rocks such as limestone and volcanic rocks the slowly moving groundwater deposits dissolved mineral matter inside these voids and this produces some of the most beautiful forms of quartz that we see in geodes now the crystallization of minerals from molten rock is a process similar to water freezing although a little bit more complex the atoms inside the melted material are very mobile and hot but as it cools the atoms start to slow down and they begin chemically combining with one another this is the process that produces igneous rocks that consist of interground crystals which we will talk about in much greater detail in the igneous rocks module but this is the second way that minerals can form through crystallization and then finally minerals can form due to deposition in one way minerals can be deposited is as a result of a biological process now water dwelling organisms can transform substantial quantities of dissolved material into mineral matter for example corals can create large quantities of marine limestone which are rocks composed of the mineral calcite they absorb calcium ions from the seawater and then they use it to secrete external skeletons which are composed of that calcium carbonate or calcite over time these small organisms are capable of creating massive limestone structures known as coral reefs other marine invertebrates like clams and oysters can also secrete shells composed of this calcite and some of them use another mineral called aragonite when their remains are buried they become major components of the sedimentary rock limestone which again we will talk about later in the sedimentary rocks module now some microorganisms like tiny diatoms and radiolaryns can even produce glass-like skeletons and they produce it using the same process but forming silicon dioxide or quartz instead of that calcite and these are the main components of rocks such as chert or flint again these topics will come up again when we review sedimentary rocks now minerals can even form from deposition near volcanic vents or fumaroles where it sublimates from a stream of hot gases like sulfur that i have shown here now there are three general processes that can destroy minerals we can melt minerals dissolve minerals or there are various other chemical reactions that can actually destroy minerals there's a considerable range of melting temperatures for different compositions of minerals all the silicates are molten at about 1200 degrees celsius now different places on earth where we can facilitate the destruction of minerals by melting would be at plate boundaries such as divergent plate boundaries and convergent plate boundaries with subduction we will talk a lot more about the melting and cooling of minerals and rocks later on when we get to the igneous rocks module but melting minerals is one way we can destroy them a second way is by dissolving them water is a solvent that dissolves minerals from the rocks and when it comes into contact with it when water such as rain water mixes with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or even air pockets within the soil a weak acid solution is created called carbonic acid over time this carbonic acid flows through the cracks of some rocks dissolving the minerals over time this process is called carbonation and it will come up again in the weathering module and we can also destroy minerals by various other chemical reactions chemical reactions or chemical weathering is the weakening and subsequent disintegration of a rock and its minerals by certain chemical reactions now these reactions include oxidation and hydrolysis these processes can destroy minerals and alter the nature of the rock's mineral composition oxidation is the reaction of a rock's minerals with oxygen iron barren minerals will rust hydrolysis is a chemical reaction caused by water water can change the chemical composition and the size of minerals in a rock making them less resistant to weathering we will talk more about these processes in the weathering module later on in the semester next we're going to go ahead and talk about the two different categories of minerals silicate minerals and non-silicate minerals

howdy everyone we are now going to get into a little bit about mineral classification starting with silicate minerals all silicate minerals contain oxygen and silicon and most of them contain one or more of the other common elements the structure of every silicate mineral includes the silicon oxygen tetrahedron in this structure we have four oxygen ions that are covalently bonded to a silica ion which you can see is much smaller and together they form this tetrahedron which is this pyramid-shaped structure remember how i showed you the crystal form of quartz and how it had that pyramid-shaped appearance well this is exactly why quartz is just made of sio 4 this tetrahedron tetrahedron is quite complex ions and has a net charge of negative four this means to become electrically balanced they will usually bond with a positively charged metal ion one of the most simplest silicate structures consists of independent tetrahedra that have four oxygen ions bonded to positive ions such as the ions of magnesium iron and calcium with a plus two charge the mineral olivine is a great example of this these kind of silicates form hard dense equidimensional crystals that lack cleavage now sio4 tetrahedra can link to one another in a variety of configurations and we call this polymerization this accounts for the high variety of silicate minerals it is achieved by sharing one two three or all four oxygen atoms with an adjacent tetrahedra and tetrahedra can then form single chains double chains sheet structures or three-dimensional frame works let's take a look at what some of these structures look like as silica structures change from isolated silica tetrahedra like an a on the left two chains like in b and c to sheet structures like in d and then to frameworks like an e of silica tetrahedra the ratio of silica atoms to oxygen atoms increases as you move from a to e in the most common silicate structure all four oxygen ions are shared producing a complex three-dimensional framework examples of this include quartz and feldspars which are both commonly found in continental crust now except for quartz the basic structure of most silicate minerals have a net negative charge therefore metal ions are usually required to bring the overall charge into balance and they are used to hold these structures together the positively charged ions of iron magnesium potassium sodium aluminum and calcium are most often linked to these silicate structures as a general rule of thumb the covalent bonds between the silicon and the oxygen are stronger than the ionic bonds that hold one silicate structure to the next this creates properties that we talked about such as cleavage and to some extent this also dictates the hardness of the mineral now most silicates form from molten rock cooling and crystallizing the feldspars are the most common silicate group and make up more than 50 percent of earth's crust quartz is the second most abundant mineral in the continental crust and the only common mineral made completely of silicon and oxygen now silicates can be divided into two groups we call them light or non-ferromagnesian and dark ferromagnesium groups so here are just some of the most common silicate minerals we have olivine which is that green mineral see we have ogite which is a pyroxene we have hornblende which is an amphibole there's biotite and muscovite which are both micas we have our feldspar group like potassium feldspar and then we have our quartz now if you take the lab portion of this class you will probably get to work with all of these minerals in person and you will be asked to identify these using mineral properties now here's some of the most common silicate minerals in the crust again feldspars account for nearly 50 percent of the minerals found in in the crust and feldspars can be split up into plagioclase feldspars and potassium feldspars and the second most abundant is quartz at 12 percent and then we have pyroxenes which include agite we have micas amphiboles which include hornblende clay minerals and then other silicates so silicate minerals account essentially for 92 percent of the minerals found in the crust whereas the non-silicate minerals which we'll talk about in the next video only account for eight percent all right so now i mentioned that we can split silicates into two groups based on light and dark let's start with the light ones the light silicates which we can call them non-ferromagnesian that's a really long word what does that mean ferro means iron magnesium means magnesium and non means doesn't contain so light silicates do not contain iron or magnesium so light silicates tend to be lighter in color they also have a specific gravity of approximately 2.7 so they're not as dense they have a low density now these silicates can contain varying amounts of aluminum potassium calcium and sodium but the important part is that they lack iron and magnesium the feldspar group kind of falls in this category they're the most common mineral group they form under a wide range of temperatures and pressure they exhibit two directions of perfect cleavage at 90 degrees and the two most common members are orthoclase which is potassium feldspar and plagioclase which is sodium and calcium feldspar and if you take the lab portion of this class you'll see these both again light silicates are going to be light in color low in density with a lower melting point making them easier to melt and are commonly found in continental crust here's just some images of some of those common feldspar minerals these are considered our light silicates here on the top we have potassium feldspar and then on the bottom we have plagioclase feldspar quartz is another example of a light silicate it is the only common silicate composed entirely of oxygen and silicon however the impurities of other elements that are found is what causes the variety in color quartz is hard and very resistant to weathering they don't display cleavage but they do display concoil fracture due to the three-dimensional framework they often form hexagonal crystals and again their color is dictated by the impurities that are found within the crystalline structure muscovite is another common member of the light silicate minerals and is part of the mica family they have excellent cleavage in one direction muscovite can almost be peeled into sheets along this one plane of clothing muscovite occurs in thin sheets that are almost clear and they're used as glass during the middle ages muscovites produce the glimmering brilliance often seen in beach sand clay minerals are another example of light silicates and clay is a general term it's used to describe a variety of complex fine grained minerals that have sheet structures clays make up a large percentage of soil most originate as products of chemical weathering which we'll talk about in a later module kaolinite is a common clay mineral used to manufacture fine china and it's photographed here all right now on to the second group the dark silicates or ferromagnesian remember ferro meaning iron magnesium meaning magnesium so these silicates contain iron and or magnesium in their structure this makes them generally dark in color and has a specific gravity between 3.2 and 3.6 which makes them more dense olivine group minerals are included in the dark silicates and they have high temperature silicates so they have a higher melting point it's harder to melt this dark silicate group olivines are black to green in color they have a glassy luster and concoidal fracture they do not display cleavage they usually form small and rounded crystals and they're common in oceanic crust and constitute 50 of the earth's mantle now dark silicates the important part to remember these is they are dark in color because they contain iron and or magnesium this makes them more dense and requires a much higher temperature to melt and they are most commonly found in oceanic crust peroxide group is another group in the dark silicates and they are important components of dark colored igneous rocks angeli is the most common mineral in the pyroxene group it is black in color and has two distinct cleavages at nearly 90 degrees it is the dominant mineral and basalt amphibole group is very similar to the pyroxene group and they're hard to identify between the two one way to tell them apart is by their cleavage the amphibole group also has two perfect cleavages however they exhibit angles of about 120 degrees and 60 degrees warm blend is the most common mineral in this group it's usually black to dark green and again looks very similar in appearance to odd giant so you have to pay attention to those cleavages now if you take the lab portion of this class you'll probably explore that more in lab so here's just showing the differences between pyroxene and amphibole or agite and hornblende they're nearly identical but one way to tell them apart is the differing angles of their cleavage planes biotites and garnets are other common dark silicates biotites are iron-rich member of the mica family they're very similar to the muscovite that i showed earlier except for these contain magnesium and iron making them darker in color but they still have excellent cleavage in one direction and produce this sheet-like structure garnets are composed of individual tetrahedra linked by metallic ions very similar to olivine garnets have glassy luster they lack cleavage and have concoidal fracture also similar to olivine the colors vary but most often they're found to be brown red they have well developed crystals and have 12 diamond shaped faces here's a picture of a well-formed garnet crystal now that ends our lecture video on silicate minerals we are now going to move on to our next and final video of module 3 on non-silicate minerals

howdy everyone you have made it to the final video of module 3. in this video we're going to be talking about the other group of minerals that we're just going to lump together as non-silicate minerals so we spent a decent amount of time in the last video talking about silicate minerals that make up about 92 percent of the earth's crust what about that other eight percent well for the purpose of this class we're just going to lump them all into a group called non-silicates now non-silicate minerals are divided into their own groups based on the negatively charged ion or the complex ion that the members all have in common now these groups can include carbonates halides oxides sulfides sulfates and native elements so here's a chart showing some of the most common non-silicate minerals and all those mineral groups i just mentioned here at the top of the cart uh chart is carbonates carbonates are made of a negatively charged carbonate ion that's what they all have in common and you can see here a couple of photographs of examples of the most common carbonates such as calcite which is there at a and dolomite which is b and we're going to talk about that a little bit more here shortly and the second group halides halides they consist of negatively charged ions of chlorine fluorine or bromine and those minerals can include halite we've talked a lot about halite that's our table salt fluorite and sylvite and i have halite pictured here at c and fluorite the purple mineral pictured at d then we have our oxides and oxides have a negatively charged oxygen ion that we call an oxide and some of these minerals include hematite magnetite corundum and even ice believe it or not so here i have photographed a hematite which is shown in e and magnetite which is shown in f and hematite and magnetite are both magnetic although magnetite is much more strongly magnetic than hematite all right moving on to sulfides sulfides all contain a negatively charged sulfur ion and some examples of these are galena sparlite pyrite calcopyrite and cinnabar and here i have photographed galena at g and h we have calco pyrite then we have some sulfates which are a negatively charged sulfate ion so4 and these can include gypsum anhydrate and barite and here i have photographed gypsum at i and anhydrate at j and then we have a lot of native elements and what exactly are native elements well they're just single elements remember that periodic table of elements well there are some elements in that table that exist on their own some examples are gold copper diamond graphite sulfur and silver these are just single elements that are not bonded to anything else and here i have photographed at k we have copper and l we have sulfur these are minerals that we can find in our earth that occur naturally without being bonded to anything else so carbonates are probably the most common non-silicate mineral group and again carbonates are composed of the carbonate ion which is co3 that means it has three oxygen atoms bonded to one carbon atom and this ion in carbonates has a negative two charge now all carbonates have this carbonate ion but then they're also bonded to something else and it has to be a positive ion now the two most common carbonates are calcite and dolomite and these are the primary building blocks of rocks called limestone and dullestone now take a look at calcite and dolomite's chemical formula calcite is caco3 that co3 is that carbonate ion and it is bonded to a calcium ion that has a plus two charge now dolomite is camgco32 in this mineral we have two carbonate ions which is that co3 and those two carbonate ions are bonded to a calcium and a magnesium that both have positive charges and one useful thing about carbonates is that they help us identify them by reacting with hydrochloric acid remember i mentioned calcite will react with hydrochloric acid now dolomite and the other carbonates will also react although probably to a lesser extent than calcite and if you take this lab portion of this class i'm sure you're going to explore that further now carbonates are very important to us because we use them as road aggregate building stones and it's the main ingredient in cement some other non-silicate minerals also have great economic value to us including halite remember halite is salt gypsum is a sulfate that we use to make plaster and other building materials hematite and magnetite are both oxides and they're mined for the iron that they contain sulfides like galena spharlite and calcopyrite are also mined for the metals they contain like lead zinc and copper then of course our native elements such as gold silver and diamonds are extremely valuable so this concludes our module three you should now have all of the information you need to complete the participation activity however i highly recommend that you review chapter 3 in your textbook before taking the quiz especially sections 3.1 3.2 3.3 and 3.4 however if you have any questions at all please reach out to me

howdy everyone and welcome to module 4 of this class in this module we're going to explore magma and igneous rocks but in this video i'm just going to barely scratch the surface just to kind of introduce the topic to you now magma is completely or partly molten rock and it's located beneath the earth's surface which when it's cold solidifies into igneous rocks igneous rocks are composed mainly of the silicate minerals we talked about last week magma is the parent material of igneous rocks and magma is formed by the partial melting in the earth's crust which we will talk about in much more greater detail later on in this module most magmas consist of three materials there's a liquid component or we call it a melt and this liquid melt is composed mainly of mobile ions of those eight most common elements in the earth's crust like remember silicon and oxygen but also aluminum potassium calcium sodium and iron and magnesium we can also have a solid component and this solid component consists of silicate mineral crystals remember minerals are solid and as the magma body begins to cool the size of the solid component will grow and we'll talk about this process again in much greater detail later and then we also have a gas component which we call volatiles volatiles are the materials that vaporize or form a gas at the surface and these are most commonly found as water vapor carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide now the volatiles can exist dissolved in the liquid melt or they can exist as gas bubbles within the melt now as magma begins to cool we start to form crystalline rock by a process we call crystallization which we briefly introduced last module crystallization is essentially the reverse event of melting so you can kind of think of it as freezing in a way as a magma crystallizes it results in those mobile ions that begin to slow as it cools and as these mobile ions slow they start to form a systematic arrangement in an orderly pattern and they begin forming mineral crystals now silicon and oxygen atoms usually link together first to start forming those lovely silicon oxygen tetrahedra that i'm sure all of you missed dearly from last week as it continues to cool and heat is lost those tetrahedras start forming and joining to each other and they even start joining to other ions in the mill to form crystal nuclei so the minerals that form the earliest end up having the most space to grow and have a better chance to develop those beautiful crystal faces than the minerals that start to form later on in the process igneous rocks are composed of interlocking crystals that were formed during the process of crystallization here is an example of an igneous rock that was formed from the crystallization of magma here you can see several minerals in its texture those gray and glassy grains are quartz most of the white crystals you see here are called plagioclase feldspar while the pink ones are potassium feldspar calcium is what actually gives it the pink color and then the black minerals you see here are mostly amphibole like the horn blend we saw in the last module and this rock pictured here is a common igneous rock called granite you've probably seen it before so as we will get into much more detail later on in the videos igneous rocks form in two basic settings they can form from the crystallization of magma at depth which means below the earth's surface and form what we call intrusive igneous rocks or sometimes we call them plutonic rocks these rocks can be found at the surface if over time the rock above is eroded away or something happens like a huge plate tectonic process of mounting building that uplifts these rocks to the surface but the rocks are formed below the earth's surface igneous rocks can also be formed by the solidification of lava or from volcanic debris after a volcanic eruption these rocks are called extrusive because they are found at or above the earth's surface we sometimes refer to these rocks as volcanics in the next two videos we will explore further how we actually classify igneous rocks

howdy everyone now we're really going to get into the details of this module in this video we are going to be looking at igneous compositions now igneous rocks are composed of mainly silicate minerals and remember we categorize those silicate minerals into two categories we call them dark silicates or ferromagnesian and light silicates or non-ferromagnesian now remember our dark silicates are rich in iron and or magnesium ferromagnesian and some examples of these minerals that we talked about in the last module included olivine pyroxene amphibole and biotite mica now with our light silicates they contain more potassium sodium or calcium instead of iron and magnesium so non-ferromagnesium and some examples of these minerals include quartz muscovite mica and feldspars now for igneous rocks there are four broad groups based on compositional differences we call them felsic intermediate mafic and ultramafic and these four groups are how we classify igneous rocks based on their composition what is their chemical makeup what are the minerals that make up these rocks so this slide has a lot going on but it really summarizes each each of those four groups really nicely i'll start out with the felsic rocks which are considered granitic in composition and your textbook also calls it granitic now felsic rocks are rich in silica they have a silica content of anywhere between 66 and 76 percent now remember our silica are lower in density so felsic rocks are lower in density and our minerals that are rich in silica remember are light silicates which tend to be lighter in color so felsic rocks are lighter in color things like white and even pink now felsic rocks come from magmar lava and this magma or lava was pretty thick and we'll talk about that later on in this video and thick magma is often responsible for producing explosive eruptions which we'll talk about even more in the next module when we talk about volcanics and magma from these felsic rocks have been mixed with continental crust material now intermediate rocks which we sometimes refer to as antacidic in composition has a composition between felsic and mafic which we'll talk about next so in these intermediate rocks we have moderate amounts of silica anywhere between 52 percent and 66 now on intermediate rocks we also contain some dark silica minerals at least 25 so because of that they tend to be what we call intermediate in color so sometimes they appear gray or they can even have a salt and pepper appearance now our third category of composition is called mafic and mafic rocks are sometimes referred to as basaltic in composition now mafic rocks are rich in magnesium and iron and they're considered silica poor at least relatively speaking they still have 45 to 52 silica but the important part about these mafic rocks is that they're much richer in magnesium and iron and those dark silicate minerals remember contain magnesium and iron and they are also higher in density and those dark silicate minerals are also darker in color so when we see a dark-colored igneous rock we can almost always bet it's going to be mafic in composition now the magma and lava that forms these mafic rocks tend to be thin and runny and we'll talk about why later on in this video but the magma that made these mafic rocks is made up of mostly mantle material the mantle is very rich in magnesium and iron now there's a fourth category of composition called ultramafic rocks and these are very rare you probably will never see them out in nature and these rocks originate in the upper mantle now because they are originating in that upper mantle they have extremely low silica content at least relatively speaking now silicates are the most common mineral in the earth's crust so we still have 38 to 45 silica content in ultramafic rocks but the important part about these is they have an extremely high magnesium and iron content which makes them very dense and very dark and most of the time these mafics even appear green in color and i'll show pictures of that later on in this video but the primary mineral involved in ultramafic rocks is something called olivine which is a green mineral so here's a nice chart that shows igneous compositions very well we have our four categories we have our felsic or granitic our intermediate or and acidic mafic or basaltic and then ultra mafic so let's start with felsic there on the left in pink again felsic is sometimes called granitic and felsic igneous rocks that we find are called granite which is the phaneritic version phaneritic is a fancy word for coarse grained and we will get into these textures in the next video and rhyolite is the aphidic version of granite or the fine green version granite and rhyolite are both two different igneous rocks that have the same exact chemical composition the only difference between the two is their texture which again we'll get into in the next video and texture is directly related to where they form now with felsic composition rocks you can see here in the chart that they consist of mostly muscovite quartz and potassium feldspar those are our light silicate minerals now moving on we're going to be decreasing silica as we move to the right intermediate composition which is sometimes called and acidic have two different kinds of igneous rocks we call that diorite and andesite both of those are identical in chemical composition the only difference is their texture now diorites and andesite are intermediate in composition so they have a little bit less silica than our felsic rocks but they have a little bit more silica than the mafic rocks which we'll talk about next so as you move to the right we're decreasing silica but we're also increasing iron magnesium and calcium now with intermediate rocks or and acidic rocks they contain mostly plagioclase feldspar and then they start to contain a little bit more amphiboles which are our dark silicate minerals now moving more to the right mafic rocks which are sometimes called basaltic two different igneous rocks that are mafic in composition are gabbro and basalt and again they're identical in chemical composition the only difference is their texture which will make more sense in the next video but with mafic rocks you can see here that they can't they contain a little bit of plagioclase feldspar but they contain mostly those dark colored minerals like pyroxenes and maybe even some olivines now going all the way to the right of this chart ultramafic we have peridotite and we have comatite which is extremely rare and i don't even think i've ever seen this kind of rock but ultramafic rocks you can see are almost entirely made up of olivine which gives them that green color so when you're looking at this chart and i recommend that you review this chart it's a very helpful chart that summarizes texture which will be in the next video and it summarizes composition very well but you can see here as your composition changes to the right we're decreasing silica content we're decreasing potassium and sodium content and we're increasing iron magnesium and calcium but at the same time as you move from left to right you're going to increase the temperature at which melting begins which is going to become important when we talk about the making of magma later on in this module so this chart is going to be really useful as we go through all of the videos in this module so i highly recommend that you review this at least several times all right so granitic or felsic versus basaltic or mafic compositions now granitic or felsic composition remember are light-colored silicates so they tend to be lighter in color and they're composed almost entirely of quartz and potassium feldspar now where do they get this funky word felsic well felsic means feldspar and silica and composition so they have a high silica content now felsic rocks only contain about 10 percent dark silica minerals so they could still have dark minerals within their complex however they are mostly light in color felsic rocks are the major component of continental crust on the other hand basaltic or mafic composition rocks contain at least 45 dark silicates and calcium-rich feldspar which makes them dark in color now where do we get the word mafic from well mafic we get the m from magnesium and f e ferum for iron so mafic means magnesium and iron in composition now magnesium and iron are very dense so these rocks have a higher density and they're darker in color than the granitic felsic rocks now basaltic rocks comprise the ocean floor and many volcanic islands they can also form very extensive lava flows on the continents which we'll talk about in the next module so here i'm showing two of the most common igneous rocks probably on the left here we have a granite which is granitic or felsic and on the right we have a basalt which is mafic now on the left the granite it's you know it's felsic because it's mostly light in color see it's mostly pink and gray and white minerals now there are some dark minerals but overall it consists of mostly light silicates whereas on the right the basalt is mostly dark in color now if we look at them both under a microscope we can see those mineral grains even closer our granite again is a felsic but it's also a coarse-grained igneous rock that's composed of those light-colored silicates like quartz which you can see really nicely in potassium feldspar now on the right of the salt if we zoom in on a microscope you can see those minerals are much smaller they're considered fine grain and but they contain a substantial amount of dark colored silicates and plagioclase feldspar so the color is really the dead giveaway of the composition of these rocks granite is a felsic because it's light in color basalt is mafic because it's dark in color now i do want to point out one thing that's very very important because both of these rocks have different textures that i'm showing at least right here any composition of magma whether it be felsic or mafic can cool into any kind of texture because texture and composition are independent of each other so not all felsic rocks are going to look like this granite and be coarse grain and not all mafic rocks are going to look like this basalt and be fine grained the texture of rocks are completely independent of composition but granite and basalt are probably the most common felsic in mafic rock so i wanted to show them here now there are other compositional groups remember our intermediate or we sometimes call it antacidic in composition now and acidic is a composition between felsic and mafic so it has a little bit more of those dark silicates than a felsic rock would and it has a little bit more of those light silicate minerals than a mafic rock one and acidic or intermediate composition rocks contain 25 percent or more of dark silicate minerals so they're a little bit darker in color than our granitic or felsic rocks and that's because they contain more dark silicate minerals like amphibole pyroxene and biotite mica now and acidic rocks are usually associated with volcanic activity on the seaward margins of the continents and volcanic island arcs and then we have our ultramafic composition which are the most rare they consist of mostly olivine and pyroxene and they're composed almost entirely of ferromagnesium minerals almost all of the minerals that make up our ultramafic rocks have magnesium and iron peridotite is a great example and it's the main component of the upper mantle so when we find peridotite rocks they're great for us to study when we're trying to understand what the upper mantle is since we can't actually travel to the mantle so silica content is a great indicator of composition crustal rocks exhibit a considerable range of silica content we talked about in the last module that the silicate minerals make up about 92 percent of the earth's crust so the crustal rocks experience a big range of that silica content our ultramafic rocks have the lowest silica content but we're still at 40 percent and our felsic rocks have the highest silica content of up to 70 percent so silica content ranges quite a lot within our crust now the silica content also influences magma behavior now granitic magmas are felsic magmas they have that higher silica content so that makes them more viscous or thick and they also erupt at a lower temperature between about 650 degrees celsius to sometimes it can get up to 1100 degrees celsius the important part to note about granitic magmas is that they have that high higher silica content a higher viscosity and a lower eruption temperature now basaltic magmas have a much more lower silica content so they behave more fluid like and they also erupt at a higher temperature up to 1250 degrees celsius so the important part to remember basaltic magmas is they have low silica they have a low viscosity and a high eruption temperature whoa okay so i probably just used some terms that you're not familiar with so let's go over some of it i mentioned that silica content is a good indicator of composition and that silica content influences magma behavior because it can make it more viscous but what exactly is viscosity well viscosity is the internal resistance to flow on the liquid the higher the viscosity the more resistance it has to flow for example if i pour honey on an inclined ramp it would take a long time for that honey to flow all the way down that's because honey has a high viscosity now if i were to pour water on an inclined ramp it would probably flow down very quickly that's because water has a low viscosity while mammals and lavas have different viscosities as well that can dictate how they flow magma and lava viscosity depends on their temperature and their composition as you increase the temperature you will have a decrease in viscosity remember as you increase temperature you will have a decrease in viscosity this means the hotter things are the more easily they can flow now why is that well heat can break bonds between atoms which makes them easier to flow past one another so the higher the temperature is the more atomic bonds will be broken and the easier it can flow and the lower the viscosity now you can also change the viscosity of a magma to lava by changing its silica content if you increase silica content you will also increase the viscosity remember an increase in silica content leads to an increase in viscosity this means the more silica you have in your melt the harder it's going to be to flow why is that well silica resists flow so if you increase the silica you will increase that resistance of flow and increase the viscosity so if we have a felsic magma and a mafic magma at the same temperature which one will have the higher viscosity the felsic magma would have the highest viscosity because it has the highest silica content these topics will come up again when we discuss volcanoes and volcanic eruptions so in summary we can tell a whole lot about igneous rocks just by looking at them and you can tell in igneous rock's composition by just simply looking at its color in general light colored igneous rocks contain a lot of light silicates and we consider them felsic because they're silica rich now dark colored igneous rocks contain a lot of dark silicates that we consider mafic which are rich in magnesium and iron and just by looking at a rock's color we can even tell a lot about the magma's behavior because we know what the composition probably was now with felsic rocks or light colored rocks that was probably formed by felsic or granitic magma and granitic magma has a lower temperature and a higher viscosity it's thicker now dark colored igneous rocks are probably mafic in composition which means the magma was probably mafic or basaltic in composition as well and basaltic magma has a higher temperature and a lower viscosity they flow much easier now these properties are really important when we study volcanic eruptions so they will come up again so now i just like to show what some of these rocks actually look like now if you take the lab portion of this class you'll actually get to see some of these rocks in person but i don't think you're required to take the lab portion of this class i want to make sure you're actually able to see what some of these look like so here i have photographed here a granite and granite is the most common felsic rock remember felsic is usually lighter in color and these rocks are lighter in color at least for the most part felsic rocks are lighter in color because they contain those light silicates which are lower in density and rich in silica so here we have granite and granite is formed by granitic lava crystallizing beneath the ground and that magma is probably very thick because we know it had a lot of silicon because it's felsic because it's light in color so here's the most common mafic rock called basalt and you can see basalt makes up a lot of the landscapes we see here and here i have a sample of a basalt rock now how do i know basalt is mafic well just by looking at this rock you can see that it's dark in color which probably means it has a lot of dark silicates and dark silicates are full of magnesium and iron making it a mafic rock magnesium and iron are also very dense and the lava that formed this basalt was probably very thin and runny because it was not rich in silica and magnesium and iron have a higher melting point so the temperature had to have been higher so you see how we can tell a lot about a rock and its origin and its composition just by looking at it and then here we have the most common ultramafic rock peridotite which again is not common at all this is the rarest type of igneous rocks but they're very beautiful to look at so i'd like to include them peridotite is ultramafic because it has extremely high magnesium and iron content almost all the minerals in a prototype have magnesium and iron and actually the main mineral is olivine which is the green mineral which gives the ultramafic rocks its green color now in the next video we are going to look at how we can classify igneous rocks not just by their composition but also by their texture

howdy everyone we are now going to move on to how we classify rocks based on their rock texture now remember when i showed this slide when we talked about the rock cycle and i mentioned that igneous rocks can be classified into two groups called intrusive and extrusive and these groups describe where they form now when they're formed by the cooling of magma and magma is the unerupted melted material beneath the earth's surface we call that intrusive now when igneous rocks are formed by the cooling of lava and lava is the erupted material above the earth's surface we call that extrusive so extrusive igneous rocks are formed after an eruption where intrusive igneous rocks are formed below the earth's surface when magma is allowed to cool slowly over time now we can tell a whole lot about a rock and where it's formed based on its texture and that's what this video is going to go over the texture of an igneous rock can tell us if it's extrusive or intrusive so i'll start with our intrusive igneous rocks remember sometimes we call them platonic now the easiest way to remember intrusive igneous rocks is that they form inside the earth and because they're forming inside the earth they have much more time to cool slowly because they're not in direct contact with the much cooler atmosphere above they're insulated deep under now underneath the ground so these rocks are able to cool much more slowly over time and because of that the minerals begin to crystallize in that magma and they have much more time to grow and much more space to grow and this creates a texture we call phaneritic and phaneritic is just a fancy word for coarse grained texture and here i have two photographs of intrusive igneous rocks i have a felsic version of one remember felsic light in color is our pink granite here on the left now when you look at granite you can see that it is full of many different minerals because the crystals are coarse grained and we can see them easily with the naked eye and that's because granite formed underneath the earth's surface and it cooled slowly over time it's an intrusive rock now over on the right is an intermediate version of an intrusive rock called diuret remember intermediate means that it's in between felsic and mafic and sometimes it can have this salt and pepper appearance like the diorite shown here now this diorite you can see has at least two different types of minerals because you can see two different types dark colored and light colored very easily with the naked eye they're very coarse grained crystals and the reason why they're coarse grained is because they were formed inside the earth and they cold much more slowly over time now the slower the cooling the bigger the crystals now extrusive igneous rocks the easiest way to remember extrusive is they form on the exterior of the earth because they are forming above the earth they cool much more quickly because they are in direct contact with the atmosphere which is much cooler so extrusive igneous rocks are cooling much more quickly so that means they don't have as much time for those minerals and crystals to really develop into a coarse grain texture our extrusive igneous rocks have a texture called a phonetic aphanitic is just a fancy word for fine grain it means the crystals are pretty small and hard to see we can also get a texture called vesicular vesicular is just a kind of spongy texture which i have shown here in the center and it's showing preserved gas bubbles now rocks that exhibit this vesicular texture code very fast so fast that the gas didn't even have time to fully escape the melt so the gas bubbles were preserved in the solid rock now another texture that we see in extrusive rocks is called glassy and it looks exactly like that it looks like glass or volcanic glass obsidian which is pictured here on the right is one example of that now glassy rocks are extrusive rocks that formed extremely fast so fast that sometimes when this material is erupted from a volcano that it almost cools in the atmosphere before it even hits the ground and because it cools extremely fast there's literally no time for any mineral crystals to develop within that melt so it preserves that glassy texture now what exactly do i mean by texture texture is used to describe the overall appearance of a rock based on the size shape and arrangement of the mineral grains and they can reveal a great deal about the environment which it formed texture or really the grain size is a direct reflection of the cooling rate the more time a magma or lava has to cool the larger the crystals will be the amounts of silica can also to a lesser extent influence texture because silica rich minerals tend to be the first to crystallize in a melt and the amount of dissolved gases within a magma and lava can also influence the texture now here's a great diagram showing all the different textures that we can see in igneous rocks now here on the diagram in a you see a glassy texture this is composed of unordered atoms and resembles a dark manufactured glass that's because it formed so quickly that it had no time for any minerals to crystallize out of that melt before it was solidified obsidian which is what's photographed there is a natural glass and it's usually formed when highly silica rich magmas solidify very rapidly obsidian is an extrusive igneous rock we know that because of its glassy texture now below that in b we have something called a porphyritic texture which i haven't talked about yet but i'll show it again later in this video but a porphyritic texture composes of two distinctly different crystal sizes so you can see in this rock in b there are some large crystals but these large crystals are in a very fine-grained matrix so we have fine-grained and coarse-grained minerals together in a rock and this kind of rock forms whenever at first the magma is allowed to cool slowly but then something happens that makes it cool much more quicker so that's how we get these two distinctly different crystal sizes and we call it porphyritic now below that in c we have phaneritic again phaneritic's just a fancy word for coarse grain texture and here the mineral grains are large enough to be identified without a microscope they're all coarse-grained and phaneritic rocks are considered intrusive igneous rocks because they're formed inside the earth now moving on to the right side of this diagram and d this is an example of a vesicular texture and it's a pumice vesicular texture is shown in extrusive rocks that form on the exterior of the earth's surface and this extrusive rock contains voids that's left by the gas bubbles that escape as the lava solidify so it forms very quickly that it doesn't even have time for that melt to settle when the gas is escaping so it preserves those gas bubbles in the solid rock and pumice is a frothy volcanic glass that displays a vesticular texture so it's just like our obsidian except for it's very frothy it's full of a lot of gas but it forms very quickly to the point where it doesn't have time for any minerals or crystals to really grow now below that an e we have an example of a pyroclastic or sometimes we call it fragmental texture now i haven't talked about this one either but i'll talk about it in later in the video the pyroclastic textures are produced by the consolidation of fragments that may include ash once molten blobs or large angular blocks that were ejected for an explosive volcanic eruption so these are extrusive rocks and they tell us a lot about how a volcano erupted when we see pyroclastic textured rocks we know there must have been a violent eruption now in our last example in f this is an a phonetic textured rock remember ethnic is just a fancy word for fine grained texture aphonetic textures are composed of crystals that are too small for the individual minerals to be identified without a microscope so there are indeed crystals interlocked within this texture we just need a tech we just need a microscope to observe them they're fine grain so a phonetic textured rocks are considered extrusive igneous rocks they form on the exterior of the earth's surface and they cool much more quickly than they would below the earth's surface so here's just some more detail on those textures that we can see now we have lots of different types of igneous textures that we just were introduced to in the last slide and the rate of choline tends to be the dominant factor now aphanitic or fine grain texture is when we have a rapid rate of cooling this produces microscopic crystals phaneritic texture or coarse grain texture is a result of slow cooling and this produces large visible crystals and porphyritic texture is when you have large crystals which we sometimes call phenocrysts that are embedded in a matrix of smaller crystals which we call a ground mass and rocks with this texture are called porphyry here's another example of a porphyritic texture you can see here the phenocrysts are the white crystals in this mass whereas the ground mass are much smaller dark colored crystals this is an example of a porphyritic texture and this can happen when a melt is allowed to cool slowly at first but then the colon speeds up now the other types of igneous textures are vesicular texture and this occurs when rocks contain voids left by gas bubbles in the lava and it's a common feature of extrusive igneous rocks glassy textures are the result of very rapid cooling and this is happens when the ions are frozen in place before they can unite in an orderly crystalline structure it has no time for it to really develop into any mineral grains pyroclastic or fragmental texture forms when the consolidation of individual rock fragments are rejected during explosive eruptions so these kind of rocks can tell us a lot about how a volcano erupted texture is usually the result of a very violent eruption and then we have another texture we haven't talked about yet called pegmatitic and pegmatitic texture are exceptionally coarse grained and they form in the late stages of crystallization of magmas and they produce rocks that we call pegmatites here's another example of vesicular texture here you can see the lava flow is very thick it's very viscous and sometimes these thick viscous lavas contain a lot of gas and as they cool it becomes difficult for that gas to fully escape the melt so we get those gas bubbles preserved in the solid rock and producing this vesicular texture now obsidian is an example of a glassy texture it cools so quickly that it has no time for any ions to really develop into an orderly pattern and no minerals are able to crystallize out of the melt before it's solidified and here's that pegmatitic texture this is the exceptionally coarse grained texture you can see here this rock hold extremely slow and the feldspar is massive there's a human hand for scale that's just one feldspar crystal below that is an entire quartz so you can see how they are exceptional so just to summarize iraq's texture can tell us a whole lot about where it came from in general phaneritic or coarse grain textured rocks are intrusive because they form inside the earth and aphanitic rocks or fine-grained rocks are extrusive they're formed on earth's exterior iraq's texture can tell us a lot about how quickly it cold also in general pegmatitic texture is extremely slow cooling phaneritic or coarse grain textured rocks means it cold slowly aphanitic or fine grain rocks the result of fast cooling vesicular rocks are the result of very fast cooling glassy rocks are the result of extremely fast cooling and then our porphyritic are the result of slow and then fast cooling and then finally a rock's texture can even tell us sometimes about how it was erupted hieroclastic textured rocks are usually the result of a very violent explosive eruption hopefully i convinced you how cool igneous rocks are you can go on a hike and find an igneous rock and just by looking at it can tell a whole lot about its history so let's practice igneous rocks real quick and if you took the lab portion of this class you're going to be doing this in person but there on the left i have a rock let's start with this one now let's think back to the last video and we talked about composition what composition do we think the rock on the left has we see that it has some dark colored minerals but for the most part it consists of mostly light colored minerals white and pink that means this probably contains a lot of light silicate minerals which makes it felsic in composition now let's take a look at its texture right off the bat you can see that there are individual crystal grains because this is coarse grain it is phaneritic what does that tell us well because the crystals are big in this rock we know that it must have cold slowly it must have cold beneath the earth's surface so how in the world did we come into contact with it today if it formed beneath the earth's surface well there could have been erosion or some kind of uplift event that brought this rock to the surface to where we're able to observe it today so you just were able to tell a whole lot about this rock just by looking at it you know it's composition you know where it formed you know how fast it cold this rock on the left is called a granite in the next video we'll actually talk about classifying and naming igneous rocks now let's take a look at the rock on the right first let's try to determine its composition we see that it is dark in color what does that dark color mean it means this probably contains a lot of dark silicate minerals dark silica minerals are rich in magnesium and iron magnesium and iron are usually darker in color and they form rocks that are mafic in composition so just by looking at the color of this rock we know that it is mafic in composition now let's take a look at its texture we don't really see individual crystal grains like we do on the rock on the left that's because this rock is aphanitic it is fine grain what does that tell us that tells us it must have cooled quickly above the earth's surface after a volcanic eruption see just by looking at this rock you also were able to tell a whole lot about what it was made out of where it was from and how quickly it cooled now taking a look at both of these rocks again you can also tell a whole lot about how the magma or the lava behaved remember that rock on the left that's a felsic rock felsic rocks are rich in silica which makes the magma very thick and sticky very viscous that means if this rock would have erupted it probably would have been an explosive eruption because that magma was very thick and sticky however we know it didn't erupt because of the coarse grain texture it cold below the earth's surface the rock on the right we determined was mafic because it's dark in composition it's made out of magnesium and iron which have high melting points now we know that this rock was formed from lava so this happened after an eruption and this lava was probably very thin and runny so again you can tell a whole lot about the rocks not just about where they form what they're made out of and how quickly they cold but you can even tell about how the magma and lava behaved and even what kind of eruption may have occurred in the next video we're going to go ahead and explore how we classify igneous rocks or how we name them and some of the properties that are associated with that

howdy everyone and welcome to the video in module 4 where we will be discussing making magma in order to understand the origin of magma we must first introduce the geothermal gradient the geothermal gradient is the increase in temperature with depth and on average every kilometer deep we go into the earth we see about an increase of 25 degrees celsius as you will soon see this means that the rocks in the lower crust and upper mantle are near their melting points they are unable to melt on their own and require some kind of tectonic process to actually trigger the melting by either reducing their melting point and there are three ways we can facilitate melting and they are by decreasing the pressure adding water or increasing the temperature of the crustal rocks so here is a wonderful diagram showing us that geothermal gradient the x-axis is showing us temperature which is increasing from left to right the y-axis is showing us depth which increases from top to bottom so as we go deeper into the earth we reach deeper and deeper depths of below of this chart now the solid red curved line that's the geothermal gradient and you can see that the temperature is rising with an increase in depth the area that's shaded in green represents where we would find solid rock the orange area is where we can expect to find partial melting to begin and the yellow area is where we would expect complete melting as you can see here at the depth of the upper asthenosphere the red curve which again is our geothermal gradient is close to that orange zone but everything in here is still solid remember only the outer core is liquid the rest of the interior of the earth is solid so how in the world is magma produced then well since in the upper asthenosphere we are so close to the boundary of partial melting we only require a slight change in conditions to cause mantle rock to partially melt this again is caused by decreasing the pressure which we call decompression melting adding water to lower the melting point or by increasing the temperature decompression melting occurs when we reduce the confining pressures enough to lower the melting temperature what does this mean well as you can imagine the deeper we go into the earth the more pressure we can experience and this pressure can make it harder to melt things because as you increase the pressure you typically increase the melting point as well now if we were to take very hot rocks that were very deep inside the earth and suddenly brought them to a shallower depth their melting point would be lower enough to allow them to begin to melt this is a process that's commonly found at divergent plate boundaries and hot spots here's a nice diagram that shows that decompression melting so here on the x-axis we have increasing temperature as you move left to right on the y-axis we have increasing pressure from top to bottom the green area is where we would expect to find solid material and the yellow area is where we can expect to find liquid the red line is called the melting curve you can see here that the melting temperature increases with depth but if we were to take hot solid rock from deeper below and just move it upwards we could rise it enough to a depth that had a lower melting temperature and the substance would then be able to melt again this is exactly what is happening at mid-ocean ridges as the hot materials rising upwards from the mantle facilitating melting and then forming that new oceanic crust the same thing is happening at hot spots where we have mantle plumes bringing hot mantle material upwards to lower pressures which then facilitate its melting and forms volcanoes in both of these cases we have mantle material being melted which makes the magma and the lava basaltic in composition now here's another diagram showing that decompression melting and this is being shown at a mid-ocean ridge remember at mid-ocean ridges we have hot mantle material that's rising upwards so as that material is rising upwards it's very hot but we're bringing it to less pressure which means it can melt at a lower temperature so because this material is super hot it begins to melt because we've lowered the pressure this is called decompression melting and we're forming basaltic magma and that basaltic magma is buoyant it's less dense than the surrounding rock so it's going to continue to rise and eventually reach the surface of the earth and form that new oceanic crust another factor that influences the melting is the water content water and other volatiles act on a rock the same way that salt acts on ice water causes the rock to melt at lower temperatures just like the throat the salt that we throw outside on an icy day enhances melting on the icy sidewalk this probably isn't the best analogy to use here at texas a m because we don't really see very much snow or ice here this introduction of water to generate magma mainly occurs at convergent plate boundaries with subduction zones where we have those cold slabs of oceanic lithosphere that is subducting into the mantle not only is the oceanic crust over lane with water but as the new hot crust that is being formed near the ridge cools it interacts with all this water as the sea water circulates through the new hot crust the water becomes hot enough to react with the layers of basalt and then it forms hydrated minerals that contain water in their chemical makeup so when a slab of this hydrated mineral rich oceanic crust reaches a subduction zone it will begin to descend into the hot mantle below and as this plate sinks it starts to warm up and it causes all these hydrated minerals to release their water in a metamorphic process we call dehydration because water is buoyant and less dense than its surrounding it will begin to migrate upwards into a wedge of hot mantle that lies directly above the subducting plate this addition of the water will lower the melting temperature enough to facilitate melting and generate basaltic magma the addition of the water and the other volatiles like carbon dioxide make this basaltic magma a little bit more explosive than the magmas generated by decompression melting now here's a diagram that shows that melting by adding water you can see here the oceanic place plate being subducted underneath the continental plate and as that oceanic plate is subducted and reaches temperatures that are high enough for the water to be released from the hydrated minerals and that water migrates upwards into the mantle lowering the melting point and facilitating that melting and that's how we have basaltic magma forming and then that basaltic magma is buoyant it's less dense than its surrounding so it's going to begin to rise this is how we facilitate melting by just the addition of water now basaltic magmas usually erupt on the ocean floor to produce sea mounds or eventually form volcanic islands like hawaii however in continental settings this magma often ponds beneath the very thick and low density crustal rocks these heat from the magma cannot be hot enough to facilitate the melting of the continental crust material and form felsic magma if these felsic magmas reach the surface they can be some of the most explosive volcanic eruptions in earth's history felsic magma and continental rift zones are one example of heat transfer melting so are the super volcanoes found at continental hot spots things can get a little more complicated geologists have observed that over time a single volcano can extrude different types of lava to understand why this can happen we need to take a look at bowen's reaction series bowen's reaction series describes the order in which minerals will begin to crystallize in a melt the first to crystallize is olivine as the melt begins to cool further calcium-rich plagioclase will begin to crystallize as well like pyroxene and then amphibole and so on during this complex crystallization process the composition of the remaining liquid portion is constantly changing for example once a third of the melt has been crystallized the remaining melt will have very little iron magnesium and calcium left here's a figure that shows bones reaction series very nicely here at the top you can see the excess access is representing temperature with our hottest temperatures on the left and it's cooling as we move to the right so as you can see here in bones reaction series olivine is the first mineral to begin to crystallize it begins to crystallize at right around 1200 degrees or a little bit less the next mineral to crystallize is pyroxene and as you can see olivine and pyrroxine these are the minerals that first begin to cool and crystallize and these are ultramafic and mafic minerals that means the remaining melts after our olivine and pyroxene have crystallized will be more felsic in nature after olivine and pyroxene we then have amphibole biotite mica and the rest of our plagioclase feldspar once we start to get even colder that's when we'll start to have more felsic minerals forming like potassium feldspar muscovite mica quartz and so forth so bowen demonstrated that minerals crystallized from magma in a systematic fashion as a function of temperature but how does bowen's findings explain the great diversity we see in igneous rocks at one or more stages during the crystallization of magma a separation of various components can occur one mechanism that can cause this to happen is caused crystal settling this process occurs when the earlier form minerals like olivine and pyroxenes are dense and heavier than the liquid portion and begin to sink towards the bottom of the magma chamber when the remaining melt solidifies either in place or at another location it will form a rock with a different mineral composition that is different than the parent magma the formation of a magma body having a chemical composition that is different from that of the parent magma is called magmatic differentiation here's a figure that shows the process of crystal settling in figure a we have a magma that has a mafic composition that erupts and leaves a layer of basaltic rock at the surface then at b the cooling of the magma causes crystals of the earliest minerals to form and settle out then in c we could have another eruption but the remaining melt would be enriched with silica since the magnesium iron and calcium already started to crystallize and settle out this leads to a much more explosive eruption and leaves a layer of silica rich rock at the surface recent work actually indicates that magmatic differentiation cannot account for the entire compositional spectrum of igneous rocks once a magma body forms the incorporation of foreign material can also change its composition this is called assimilation in assimilation we have magma pushing upwards that cracks the crust around it causing fractures the magma can then be injected into these fractures and begin to dislodge rock this displaced rock is then melted and incorporated into the melt changing the overall chemical composition of the magma another means by which the composition of magma can be altered is called magma mixing magma mixing can occur during the ascent of two chemically distinct magma bodies as the more buoyant mass overtakes the more slowly rising body once they are joined convective flow stirs the tube magmas generating a single mass that has an intermediate composition incomplete melting of rocks is known as partial melting this process produces most of the magmas during partial melting the melt is enriched with ions from minerals with the lowest melting temperature partial melting of ultramafic rocks yields mafic magmas partial melting of mafic rocks makes intermediate magmas and partial melting of intermediate rocks makes felsic magmas and again this partial melting process produces most of our magmas here's a figure that's just showing that partial melting you have a source wrong and it's not all being melted at the same time with partial melting you could have magma being generated from the source rock that is felsic in composition but the mafic minerals remain a solid most magmas that are erupt are basaltic or magma mafic magma most originate from partial melting or mantle rocks at oceanic ridges these melts are called primary or primitive magmas because they have not yet evolved now and acidic magma can form in two ways it can form by magmatic differentiation of mantle derived basaltic magma or can be formed by basaltic magmas assimilating crustal rock granitic magmas most often form when basaltic magma ponds beneath the continental crust heating and melting the much lower melting temperature felsic minerals it can also be formed from magmatic differentiation of antacidic magma here's a nice diagram showing the formation of felsic magma at the bottom of this figure at 1 we're seeing partial melting of peridotite that's generating basaltic magma due to decompression melting we have hot mantle material rising up here from the asthenosphere below which is at bringing it to a lower pressure facilitating that melting but what we're actually partially melting is the mantle itself which it consists of peridotite which is basaltic in composition and then that basaltic magma is less dense than its surrounding it's more buoyant so it's going to begin to rise upwards like we see here in two the basaltic magma rises through the lithospheric mantle and it continues to rise until we reach number three where we have the basaltic magma ponding underneath the less dense crustal rock and then at number four we get partial melting of that continental crust that the basaltic magma is ponding underneath this generates magma with a more felsic composition and this is how we can form felsic magma now in the next and final video of this module we will discuss more about magma movement and emplacement

howdy everyone and welcome to the last video of module 4. in this video we're going to be exploring how magma moves and some of the structures that are created from this magma movement and placement even though volcanic eruptions can be amazing events most magma actually crystallizes that depth without ever being erupted when magma rises through the earth's crust it forces the pre-existing rock or sometimes we refer to this pre-existing rock as the host rock or country rock to become displaced and the structures that result from this emplacement of magma into the host rock are called intrusions or plutons since these features form deep within the earth we are only able to study them after an uplifting or erosion event that brings them to the surface which often times happens millions of years after their formation now these intrusions or plutons can occur in a variety of sizes and shapes we will begin exploring some of these throughout this entire video there are two different classifications of plutons based on their shape and their orientation relative to the host rock we have tabular plutons which are table like and these can cut across existing structures or be parallel to the features we can also have massive plutons which essentially are just a blob shape here's a figure that shows some of these plutons very nicely in a we can see how volcanism is responsible for these intrusive bodies these blobs are the magma chambers that once cold will form plutons you can also see where magma is forced upwards in long linear pipes that cut through the existing layers of rock these are called dikes sometimes magma will travel horizontally along these layers these are called sills then we also have lacoliths which is shown right here and lacklus we will talk about later on in this video in this figure you can also see other terms like cinder cones composite cones and fissure eruptions which we will get into in the next module this figure is also a good one to study and can be found in your textbook on page 124. so let's talk about some of these tabular plutons we will start with dikes dikes form when magma is forcibly injected into fractures that cut across bedding surfaces and layers of the host rock dikes are the structures that transport magma upwards and can sometimes occur in groups that we call dyke swarms they oftentimes can radiate from a volcanic neck like spokes on a wheel here's an example of an exposed dike you can see in the distance the remnant of an ancient volcano this is actually the spanish peaks in colorado leading up to the mountain is this wall-like structure this is called a dike and it transported magma upwards feeding this once active volcano the reason the dike sticks out of the landscape like this is because the minerals that make up the dike are harder and more resistant to weathering than the surrounding rock cells are very similar to dikes however instead of being formed when magma moves upwards they are formed when magma moves laterally sills are nearly horizontal and occur when magma exploits the weaknesses along bedding planes sometimes it's easier to crack a rock along an existing layer than it is to cut through several layers if that makes sense this leads to an accumulation of magma between these layers and will increase in thickness as more and more magma is fed through closely resembled buried lava flows except they contain intrusive igneous rock since they were formed deep underground sometimes large seals will exhibit columnar jointing which occurs when igneous rocks cool and develop shrinkage fractures that produce pillar-like columns that often have six sides in our hexagonal this is similar to how mud cracks form in hexagonal shapes but instead of mud drying we have magma choline here's an example of a sill you can see here these are layers of intrusive igneous rock that follow the same horizontal pattern as the rocks above and below it here is an example of that columnar jointing again they kind of look like large three-dimensional mud cracks in igneous rocks all right so now we're going to get into the pluton blobs batholiths are the largest intrusive structure they can occur as linear structures that are several hundred kilometers long the sierra nevada batholis for example is a continuous granitic structure that forms most of the backbone of the sierra nevada mountains in california an even bigger example can be found along the coast mountains of western canada and even into southern alaska that extends over 1100 miles even though some of these bath lifts are just downright massive the majority of them are actually 10 kilometers thick or less we also tend to find them composed of mainly felsic rock like granite to intermediate types and very rarely find mafic batholis we in general call these bodies of batholis when they are exposed at the surface for over a hundred square kilometers and we then call them stocks when they are smaller than that here is a map showing these bath lists made of granite along the western margin of north america with the sierra nevadas shown here as well as the coastal range up north now lachlans can form when magma is forcibly injected between sedimentary layers of host rock and start to actually deform the rock above it as it expands you can think of these as over-inflated sills here you can see mount ellen in utah which is found in the henry mountains mount ellen is just one of five peaks that make up this smaller range mount ellen is composed of crystalline rock that was once formed deep underground this intrusive body is called a stock and if you look at the illustrated version below you can see other structures such as dikes and cells in front of mount ellen and to the left in this image we can see another uplifted feature this is an example of a lachlan and it was formed when a cell became over inflated and literally started pushing the rock above it upwards and folded the layers around it now what happens to all this rock that is being displaced when magma forces its way through while depending on the tectonic environment geologists have proposed several mechanisms to solve this problem very deep in the earth rocks tend to be more ductile in nature and are able to make room for this magma by being pushed aside and bending we call this shouldering as magma nears the surface though it starts to encounter rock that is much cooler and more brittle this rock is not easily pushed aside instead the rock will sometimes break and become dislodged and sink through the magma in a process called stoping we find evidence of this process in xenoliths which are suspended blocks of country rock found within plutons here is a photo showing an example of a xenolith you can see here that the xenolith is made of very different material than the surrounding material this xenolith is actually made of dark mafic rock that was incorporated into a felsic magma remember magma can also melt and assimilate some of this hose dark as well but in this case the magma likely wasn't hot enough to completely melt the surrounding mafic material now this concludes the videos for module 4. you should now have all the information you need to complete this module's participation activity before taking the quiz i highly recommend you read chapter 4 in your textbook especially sections 4.4 4.5 and 4.7 before your quiz as always please reach out to me with any questions this module really set the stage nice for our next module on volcanoes and volcanic hazards igneous rocks are important to study because the composition of these rocks can tell us a lot about the composition of the magmas or lavas that formed them and thus igneous rocks give us clues on how a volcano will erupt in the future that create the many hazards we will talk about that impact life on earth good luck on module 4's quiz and i will see you again in module 5.

howdy everyone and welcome to module 5. this is the final module that will be in your first exam now this module kind of continues on the topic that we discussed in the last module with igneous rocks and magma formation but here we're going to be exploring volcanoes and volcanic hazards so this tends to be one of the most favorite modules that we have and it's one of my favorites as well now before we begin exploring the nature of volcanic eruptions i just kind of wanted to show this photo and describe what exactly is a volcano well a volcano is a mountain constructed by the eruption of molten rock from the earth's interior and volcanoes are a direct consequence of plate tectonics and mantle convection now volcanoes aren't are not just one of the most beautiful landforms that we see on earth but they often tend to be one of the most deadliest which we'll soon explore later on in this module here's a map showing the locations of volcanic activity now most of the volcanic activity occurs along divergent plate boundaries especially mid-ocean ridges but thetas don't always form a volcano where we get a mountain constructed of the erupted materials most of the volcanoes that we actually see on earth occur at convergent plate boundaries and in particular ones where we have the subduction zone but we also have some volcanoes at areas called hot spots which were introduced to you in the plate tectonics module and we'll get into a little more detail here now there are different ways we can classify volcanoes but probably the most common that you're used to hearing are classifying volcanoes based on activity and there are three main classifications of volcanoes like active volcanoes dormant volcanoes and extinct volcanoes active volcanoes are currently erupting or they have erupted recently in the past and they are much more likely to erupt again dormant volcanoes have not erupted recently but they still have the capability of erupting again in the future extinct volcanoes are not expected to erupt in the future and they're not even capable of producing an eruption anymore now i like to show this and talk about the anatomy of a volcano because there are different terms that we use like in the last module we talked about magma a lot remember magma is the molten rock that usually contains some crystals and dissolved gases under the earth's surface but in this module we're going to focus a lot more on lava and lava quite simply is magma that has been erupted onto the earth's surface now remember we had different compositions of magma and the same is true for lava as well now we can lump the compositions of lava into three different types basaltic which remembers mafic and acidic which is an intermediate composition and rhyolitic which is felsic now basaltic lava usually the source is from the upper mantle which is what makes it mafic these lavas tend to have a low viscosity but the highest temperature because it requires a higher temperature to melt these types of minerals now basaltic lavas tend to have one to two percent gas content so it's the lowest gas content of the three main types of lava and they're mafic so they only have about 50 percent of silica minerals now for this module the important part to remember is that basaltic lava flows are the least explosive types now antacidic lavas are intermediate in composition so they have about 60 silica now and acidic lavas the source tends to be ocean crust and sediments and it's the ocean crust that is mafic in composition and the sediments that are felsic which means this results in an intermediate composition now and acidic lavas tend to have a medium viscosity and they have about three to four percent gas content which makes them medium explosive so not as explosive as rhyolitic which we'll talk about in a moment but a little more explosive than our basaltic lava now rhyolitic lava is felsic in composition so they have about 70 silica and that's because the source is continental crust remember our continental crust is felsic in composition so rhyolytic lavas have a high viscosity and the lowest temperature of the three main types rhyolitic lavas have four to six percent gas content so they have the most gas content out of the three main types this along with other properties is what makes it the most explosive lava type now remember that these compositional differences in magmas and lavas also affect several other properties like viscosity i showed this slide in the last module but it's really important to review it again remember viscosity is the internal resistance to flow of a liquid and a magma or lava viscosity depends on the temperature and the composition now when we have an increase in temperature we tend to have a decrease in viscosity and when we have an increasing silica content we have an increase in viscosity now mafic magmas have the lowest silica remember mafic magmas have the lowest silica they also have the lowest gas content and erupt at the highest temperatures this makes mafic magmas have the lowest viscosity remember mafic magmas have a low viscosity now felsic magmas have the highest silica and they erupt at relatively lower temperatures they also have the highest gas content so this makes felsic magmas or lavas have the highest viscosity remember felsic lava has a high viscosity now different volcanoes can erupt in different styles and we have two main eruption styles and we're going to talk about each of these in more detail the two eruption types we have are explosive which is pretty self-explanatory and effusive ephesus just a fancy word for a gentler eruption or like a pouring out of lava so what determines the explosiveness of a volcano what's determining if we're going to get an explosive eruption versus an effusive eruption well there are two main factors that determine the explosiveness of a volcano there's magma type or lava type remember felsic intermediate and mafic and this describes really the amount of silica that is contained in a melt and the second property that determines the explosiveness of a volcano is that viscosity and viscosity kind of describes how easily gas can escape from the magmar or the lava so together the magma type and the viscosity are the controlling factors that determine how a volcano will erupt now effusive eruptions are those with low viscosities remember effusive eruptions have low viscosity so these effusive eruptions are those with low viscosity lavas and they are likely mafic in composition so see how it all kind of goes together now these eruptions are caused by the dissolved gases in the melt being released which then results in the magma starting to expand and eventually allowing it to escape and forming an eruption lava fountains are very common and these eruptions can last weeks months or even years kilauea in hawaii is a perfect example of that now these types of eruptions in general will form two main land forms and we call them shield volcanoes and flood basalts shield volcanoes have a low profile resembling a warrior shield laying on the ground it is formed by the eruption of highly fluid lava which has low viscosity hence the effusive eruption this type of lava can travel farther and forms thinner flows than the more viscous lava eruptions from other types of eruptive style ant forms now flood basalts are the result of a giant volcanic eruption or really a series of eruptions that cover very large stretches of land and we'll talk about both of these in more detail so shield volcanoes are the largest volcanoes in size now even though they are the largest the slope of the volcano is very gentle so they have a low profile again similar to a warrior shield being laid down flat on the ground now shield volcanoes are characterized by quiet non-explosive eruptions that we call effusive and they contain basaltic magma or basaltic lava remember basaltic lava is low in silica and low in viscosity allowing it to flow much farther distances now the eruptions consist mainly of lava flows but we also get some tephra and that's a term we're going to be talking about in another video later on in this module so here's a photo of a very famous shield volcano you may have seen it before again shield volcanoes it doesn't really stick out of the landscape as much as a more steeper volcano would because these slopes are very gentle but these volcanoes cover a huge vast of land this is monologue in hawaii mauna loa in hawaii is a shield volcano and it is the largest volcano that we have on earth here's a little more helpful of a figure that kind of shows the size of mona loa versus mount rainier now you may have seen photos of mount rainier mount rainier looks massive and the slopes are steep but in this figure we're showing the size of mount rainier which is in the middle of this figure at a height of a little over 14 000 feet next to mauna loa and mount rainier can fit inside monoloa now you might notice that mauna loa's height is 13 677 feet which is less than mount rainier and that's because when we talk about height we're talking about in reference to sea level now if you notice monoloa starts on the oceanic floor which is 19 000 feet deep here so add that to the height of mauna loa above the sea level and it makes it one massive monster now a flood basalt is the result of a gigantic volcanic eruption or a series of eruption that covers large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basaltic lava many flood basalts have been attributed to the onset of a hot spot reaching the surface of the earth via a mantle plume here's a map that shows some of the world's flood basalts we will explore these flood basalts in a little more detail later on in this module especially the columbia river flood basalts which you can see in north america but we also have many massive flood basalts like the siberian traps and asia and the deacon traps in india so these flood basalts actually form a significant portion of the earth's surface so we will explore this later on in a different video now explosive eruptions are associated with highly viscous lavas the dissolved gases are also released here but they tend to get trapped within the magma this causes a chain reaction that generates more gas bubbles and leads to a huge explosion i think a pop can that has been shaken up is finally being opened now these types of eruptions can expel particles of fragmented lava and gases at supersonic speeds that often evolves into an eruption column which you can see here in this photograph now explosive eruptions form their own type of landforms and in general we see three main types composite volcanoes cinder cones and calderas composite volcanoes which are sometimes referred to as stratovolcanoes are conical volcanoes they're shaped like a cone and that's because they're built up by many layers of hardened lava and tephra or ash that kind of gives it that steep profile now cinder cones are also conical shaped but they're made up of loose pyre classic fragments like ash or cinder that has been built up around a volcanic vent and calderas are large depressions formed when a volcano erupts and collapses think like you have a full balloon underneath the sandbox volcano and the balloon pops creating a depression in the volcano where the balloon once was the same thing happens with volcanoes except the magma chamber is your balloon and the pop is an eruption so here's a figure showing a composite volcano again these are also called stratovolcanoes and they are conical and shaped so they're shaped like a cone and you can see here the composite volcano is built up of many layers of hardened lava and tephra or ash here's an example of a strata volcano or composite volcano mount rainier mount rainier is a volcano in washington and in this image you can even see mount st helens in the background however this photo was taken before the 1980 eruption so mount st helens looks very different today but here both of these volcanoes you can see are very steep and they are cone-shaped and they're both built up of many layers of hardened lava and ash making them a composite volcano mount fuji in japan is another perfect example of a conical-shaped volcano called a composite volcano and these volcanoes not just look beautiful but they're extremely deadly when they erupt here's a recent example of an eruption of mount aetna in italy now aetna is a composite volcano here's a photo of the mount aetna eruption at night which is spectacular and the really cool thing about this photo is you can see humans living not very far from this active volcano see those city lights in the background that's what makes studying volcanoes extremely important because we have humans all over the world living very close to these things here's the cascade range which is full of composite volcanoes we talked about mount rainier and mount st helens a little bit but there's also mount jefferson mount hood mount adams and the north and south sister and middle sister now if you've ever flown out west over this cascade range you may have noticed outside the airplane window that these volcanoes almost look like zits on the earth's surface and that's again because they're built up of many layers of hardened lava and ash over time making them very steep and they stick out of the landscape like zits on earth here showing the eruptions in the cascade range during the past 4000 years you can see these volcanoes in the cascade range are active with the most recent example being mount st helens in 1980. you can see here mount st helens has erupted many times in the past and it probably will erupt again in the future all right now cinder cones cinder cones are another example of a landform created by explosive eruptions cinder cones are much smaller but they still have steep sides they're more explosive than shield volcanoes but they're commonly found on the size of shield volcanoes and we call them parasitic cones now these eruptions are characterized by ash and cinders which are gravel-sized tephra here i have shown an example of what those centers look like they look like landscape rock and they are used a lot in landscape now here's a figure showing a cinder cone volcano again it's conical shaped like the composite volcanoes but much much smaller and made up of loose pyroclastic fragments like ash or cinder that has been built up around a vent here's some example of cinder cone volcanoes in mexico the image on the left is interrupting cinder cone again you still get those eruptive columns because they tend to be explosive in nature i mentioned that cinder cones are often found on the slopes of shiron composite volcanoes here are examples of cinder cones on the side of mauna loa and hawaii here's a cinder cone you can find when flying out over arizona this is a cinder cone on the flank of a larger volcano in arizona the pile of cinders has assumed the angle of repulse and a lava flow covers the land surface in the distance if you take a closer look here is a cinder cone volcano in a volcanic field near marysville utah and i took this photograph when i was out in utah several years ago here's me on top of that cinder cone and i can tell you this cinder cone is made up of that loose pirate classic material like that landscape lava rocks and they are very sharp and very loose now the third main type of landform created by explosive eruptions are calderas calderas are large sided depressions that have a diameter that exceed one kilometer and have a somewhat circular form they are significant features we see on the earth as a result of those explosive eruptions and we will revisit this topic again later on in this module we explore volcanic architecture but here's a figure showing exactly how caldera forms at the top of this figure you can see a volcano that starts to erupt and it is very explosive in nature and eventually that magma body almost completely drains and the land concaves within it and forms that called caldera over time sometimes we can have a new volcano form in the middle of these calderas which we call volcanic cones or soma volcanoes but the important part to remember is that caldera formations are the result from a collapse of a composite volcano with an explosive eruption here's a great example of a caldera result of this type of caldera formation is crater lake crater lake national park is found in oregon it formed from a violent eruption and explosion of mount mazama over 7 000 years ago here's another image showing of crater lake and you could see in the middle of crater lake a new volcano started to form yellowstone is another great example of a caldera and the yellowstone national park almost sits in the middle of a giant caldera from the last explosive eruption of the yellowstone super volcano about 600 000 years ago now here's a figure i like to show at the end that shows the composite versus shield volcano versus cinder cones by size remember i said shield volcanoes are the largest volcano and it is shown at the top of this figure with our largest volcano on earth monoloa now even the smallest shield volcano that we have like mount kilimanjaro is still much larger than the largest stratovolcano or composite volcano like mount shasta mount fuji is considered a medium composite volcano but it looks like a baby in comparison to mauna loa in mount vesuvius which you may have heard about is very destructive but it is so tiny in scale next to the large shield volcanoes and then remember our cinder cones how i said they are much smaller our larger cinder cone sunset crater is shown there right underneath vesuvius and that's our largest cinder cone most cinder cones are much smaller than that now that we understand a little bit about the nature of volcanic eruptions we are going to take a look at the volcanic materials such as lava pyroclastics and volcanic gases

howdy everyone and thank you for continuing on module 5. this is the second video in module 5 on volcanoes and volcanic hazards lots of material are rejected during a volcanic eruption such as lava pyroclastics and gases but in this video we are just going to focus on the lava flows remember there are three main types of lava mafic or basaltic intermediate or and acidic and felsic or rhiolytic most of the lava found on earth which is about 90 of it actually is basaltic and it is found erupting at oceanic ridges less than 10 percent is and acidic and found at volcanic chains and volcanic island arcs along plate convergent margins with subduction only about one percent is rhyolytic and found mostly in continental settings associated with hot gases and ash let's start with basaltic lava flow since they make up 90 of the earth's lavas and they make up almost 70 percent of the earth's surface there are three main forms of basaltic lava flows we call them pillow pahoe hoy and ah pillow lavas are the result of an outpouring of lava on the ocean floor the flow's outer skin quickly solidifies almost like freezing to form volcanic glass because of the drastic temperature changes between the hot magma below the earth's surface and the cool waters that are now above however the interior of the lava is able to still move forward and break through this hardened surface and begin the process over and over again this results in a lava flow composed of many tube-like structures called pillow lavas that are stacked on top of each other pillow lavas are extremely useful when studying earth's history because their presence indicates the lava flow formed below the surface of water ahoy hoy lava forms on land unlike the pillow lavas that form on the ocean floor ahoy hoy have smooth surfaces that sometimes resemble twisted braids of rope this is because pahoy hoy lavas are very hot and very fluid making them have a lower viscosity this allows them to flow over greater distances sometimes ahoy hoy lavas are also really nice to help us study past volcanic eruptions because when we find them we can infer which direction the lava was flowing at the time it formed for example here on this image we can see that the lava was flowing from the left to the right now the other lava flow that can occur on land is ah ah offloads have surfaces of rough jagged blocks with dangerously sharp edges that's because these lavas are very viscous this is because they occur at much colder temperatures than pahoehoe the hoihoe lavas can also transition into a lavas as it cools although the reverse isn't ever likely to happen remember viscosity increases as temperature decreases this increase in viscosity promotes bubble formation and the escaping gas bubbles can produce voids which we call vesicles and the surface now my earth science teacher in high school had a funny way of helping me remember the difference between pahoehoe and ah imagine you're walking over these lava flows and the sound you make if you were to walk across the jagged sharp flows of atta we would probably go ah the whole way across now if we walked across a smooth pahoehoe flow we would be much more relaxed like the word maybe this will help you remember too now the important thing to remember about pahoehoe and ah is that they are made out of the same composition the only difference between the two is their temperature which impacts their viscosity lavas of and acidic or intermediate composition form somewhat of a different lava flow known as block lava block lavas resemble a lava because they have a high viscosity block lavas tend to generate short but prominent flows their upper surface consists of largely massive detached blocks these blocks tend to be slightly curved with smooth surfaces instead of sharp and jagged like now remember the character of lava flows depends on viscosity basaltic lava is less viscous than antacidic and rhyolytic llama the more viscous alaba is the greater its resistance to flow for example honey is more viscous than water and acidic and rhyolitic lava are more viscous than basaltic lava now lava isn't the only thing that is released during an eruption in the next video we will talk about the other two components of interruption pyroclastics and volcanic gases

howdy everyone in this video we're going to be exploring the additional material that is ejected from a volcanic eruption other than lava such as pyroclastic materials and volcanic gases the dissolved gases in magma are referred to as volatiles and make up about one to eight percent of the total weight of magma as the magma reaches the surface the pressure is reduced this allows the gases to start expanding and trying to escape most of these gases come in the form of water vapor followed by carbon dioxide or co2 and sulfur dioxide or so2 along with lesser amounts of hydrogen sulfide or h2s carbon monoxide co and nitrogen n2 although the percentage may be small the actual quantity of emitted gases contributes significantly to our planet's atmosphere and global warming the actual quantity of emitted gases can exceed thousands of tons per day volcanoes are also natural sources of air pollution now pyroclastic material or sometimes we just call them tephra are the pulverized rock and lava fragments that are ejected during an eruption these particles can range in size from fine dust to rocks the size of minivans the smallest form of pyroclastics or tephra is volcanic ash this is the result of when a gas-rich viscous magma erupts explosively as magma moves up in the vent gases rapidly expand generating a melt that resembles froth that flows from a bottle of champagne as the heated gases expand violently the froth is blown into fine glassy fragments we know as ash when the hot ash falls and fuses together it often creates a rock we called welded tough lapilli means little stones and is a fancy word for those cinders that make up the cinder cone lapilli can range in size from small beads to the size of walnuts now blocks are much much larger than lapille blocks are made of hardened lava that are greater than two and a half inches in diameter sometimes these hardened lava fragments can reach insane sizes bombs are the material that are also greater than two and a half inches in diameter but they are ejected as hot lava because they are not completely cold and are still in a semi-molten state when ejected they take on a streamlined shape as they are hurtled through the air almost like a football now ash can travel great distances very far away from the volcano thanks to their small size and light weight making it easier to be carried up into the atmosphere however blocks and bombs usually fall near the vent due to their size and weight but occasionally they have been found to be thrown great distances for example a bomb that was 20 feet long and weighed over 200 tons was blown over 2 000 feet from a vent during an eruption in japan of mount osama here is a nice figure showing the different types of volcanic material based on size again volcanic ash is the smallest with the diameter less than two millimeters lapilli are cinders between two millimeters and 64 millimeters in diameter or point eight two and a half inches which is probably easier for most of you to envision while volcanic blocks and bombs are more than two and a half inches our classic materials can be classified by texture and composition as well as by size for instance scoria is the term for vesicular ejecta produced most often during the eruption of basaltic magmas scoria are generally found in the sizes of lapilli and form our wonderful cinder cone volcanoes scoria are black to reddish brown fragments and get this color from the magnesium and iron rich magma during a basaltic eruption hummus on the other hand is produced when magmas with antacidic or rhyolytic composition erupt explosively pumice is usually lighter in color and less dense than scoria because they are made from more felsic material and have so many vesicles allowing it to float alright so here is a very nice summary that links magma composition with all the properties we have talked about so far such as silica content gas content eruptive temperature viscosity pyroclastics and landforms this graphic will be a very useful studying tool especially for your quiz and exam so i highly recommend reviewing this figure a few more times it can also be found on page 138 of your textbook in the next video we are going to explore a little bit more on the anatomy of a volcano

howdy everyone in this video we're going to continue on with module 5 but this time we're going to explore a little bit more about the anatomy of a volcano now some general features that are associated with the volcano include things that we call fissures conduits vents and volcanic cones now we've already talked about some of these terms but here we're just going to review them in a little bit more detail now fissures are a crack that develops in the earth's crust as magma moves forcefully towards the surface and i'll show a picture of that in a couple slides a conduit is a somewhat pipe-shaped tunnel and it's usually the main tunnel that carries the magma upwards through the vent and the vent is that surface opening of a conduit now volcanic cones are the cone-shaped structure created by successive eruptions of lava empire classic material and we already looked at that when we looked at explosive eruption landforms now here's a figure that shows some of those terms um illustrated here you can see here the magma chamber coming off the magma chamber is the conduit which is carrying the magma upwards into an opening of the surface that we call a vent you can see some parasitic cones a crater and some other terms that we've already talked about like bombs lava and pyroclastic material this figure doesn't really show us a fissure very nicely here's an example of a fissure and this one's from kilauea you can see here that is literally a crack in the earth's crust where magma is allowed to ray to rise upwards now there are even more terms that describe different parts of a volcano again some of these we've already explored some features that we see are a crater which is a funnel shaped depression at the summit of most volcanic cones and they're generally less than a kilometer in diameter now i know we definitely talked about calderas which are larger than a kilometer in diameter but they're also a large circular depression and they are produced when the summit area collapses parasitic cones are features that we've talked about and they are flank vents that emit lava and pyroclastic material but not all vents that are on a flank of a volcano emit lava and pyroclastic material some just emit gases and those are called fumaroles here's an example of a crater at mount vesuvius a volcano built primarily of pyroclastic materials typically have these craters that form by the gradual accumulation of volcanic debris on the surrounding rim other craters form during explosive eruptions which are common at mount vesuvius that rapidly eject particles and erode the crater walls here is an example of a caldera which we talked about in the first video of this module they form when the summit area of a volcano collapses following an explosive eruption like crater lake after the violent eruption of mount mazama 7700 years ago shown here here's an example of parasitic cones where there are cinder cones that are usually found on the flanks of much larger shield volcanoes like here off of mauna loa funerals are similar to parasitic cones but instead of ejecting lava and tephra it just emits gases like shown here off mount aetnan italy mount edna actually has more than 200 of these along its flanks now there are other features of volcanoes that we've already talked about in the first module so i'm going to quickly review those here and that's shield volcanoes composite volcanoes and cinder cones some general features of shield volcanoes remember include that broad slightly domed shape and they're produced by the accumulation of fluid basaltic lavas which can cover large areas most of them begin on the seafloor as seamounts only a few actually grow large enough to form a volcanic island like hawaii great examples include the hawaiian islands the canary islands the galapagos and easter island and remember mauna loa is the largest volcano on earth and it is a shield volcano here's some photographs in a figure showing the volcanoes of hawaii all of the volcanoes on hawaii such as mauna loa kilauea and others are all shield volcanoes kilauea is hawaii's most active volcano and really not that long ago in 2018 multiple fissures were erupted sending lava flowing into the streets and for about a month there were actually several neighborhoods that ended up being very heavily damaged and in total it was about 600 houses and other structures that were completely destroyed now another type of volcano that we see are cinder cones which again we've talked about in the first video of this module sometimes cinder cones are also called scoria cones and they're built from the ejected basaltic lava fragments and have steep slope angles they are rather small in size though between 30 and 300 meters tall they frequently occur in groups and sometimes are associated with extensive lava fields but these generally form in the later stages of the volcano's life span perakuten located 320 kilometers west of mexico city is an example of a cinder cone here's a photograph and a figure showing the cinder cone here's one in flagstaff arizona it is an extinct volcano you can see it sticking out of the landscape very nicely with a crater on top now if you look out into the distance you can also see the preserved lava flow that's associated sometimes with cinder cones especially at the end of their life here's another cinder cone pedicutin near mexico city it erupted for nine years and in the photograph shown on the right you can see an ah flow that's emanating from the base of the cone that actually buried an entire village leaving only the remnants of this church exposed now composite volcanoes are also sometimes called stratovolcanoes and we've all already reviewed this as well these are the large classic shaped volcanoes a symmetrical cone thousands of feet high and several miles wide at the base these are composed of interbedded lava which tend to be and acidic in composition and layers of pyroclastic debris talking about all these different volcanoes types probably makes a little bit more sense now that we've talked about all of the features associated with them many of these composite volcanoes are located adjacent to the pacific ocean in that area that we explored as the ring of fire mount saint helens and mount fuji are perfect examples of these composite or strata volcanoes here's a photograph of mount fuji again a classic composite volcano located on the ring of fire here's another figure again that compares the different sizes of volcanoes our shield volcanoes are by far the largest and that's because they are formed from the less viscous basaltic lavas that are able to flow very long distances during an effusive eruption whereas the smaller yet steeper composite volcanoes are formed for more felsic lava compositions that produce layers of hardened lava and ash and cinder cones the smallest of them all are produced from layers of pyroclastics due to their viscous eruptions now fissures are features we talked about earlier in this video and they can form eruptions and create basaltic plateaus this is where fluid basaltic lava is extruded from these fissures as blankets and cover a large area we call these large igneous provinces a basalt plateau flood basalts appropriately describes these eruptions some examples of these are the columbia plateau and the decontracts here are some figures that show the fissure eruptions forming the basaltic lava flows here you can see the fissures are clearly cracks in the earth's crust that allows that hot magma to rise up to the surface and form those extensive lava fields here's that map of earth's flood basalts again you can see that they make up a significant portion of the earth's surface let's explore the youngest and smallest one but one of the best preserved continental flood basalts on earth and it is found right here in our country it's called the columbia river flood basalt thick layered lava flows found in the northwestern corner of our country in washington montana oregon idaho and even a little bit of nevada originated from one of the most highly effusive eruptions in the world the relatively flat features of solidified flood basalts which you can see here in the image on the right on the banks of the river are indicative of extremely low viscosity the many layers indicate many repeated eruptions this sequence is a classic example of a flood basalt activity that erupted more than 350 lava flows from the oldest one at the bottom 16.7 million years ago to the youngest flow on top 5.5 million years ago the eruptions originated from a series of linear fissures ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers in length the magma that fed these massive eruptions may have come from a plume-like swelling from the mantle called a hot spot since the time of eruptions the north american plate has moved and the hot spot is now believed to reside beneath the yellowstone volcano lava domes are other volcanic landforms we see on earth lava domes are small dome-shaped masses composed of rhyolitic lava rhyolite eruptions are usually explosive but not always sometimes they produce these lava domes that erupt slowly over time as the thick rhyolitic viscous lava is squeezed from a bend it produces a dome-shaped mass collapses of these lava domes often produce powerful pyroclastic flows that we will get into later on in this module volcanic necks and pipes are other features that we see that stick out of the landscape associated with volcanoes a volcanic neck is the remains of a magma that's solidified inside a conduit a great example of that is shiprock in new mexico which is photographed here the reason that these features are exposed at the surface as hills ridges and mountains is because volcanic rocks are much more resistant to weathering and the surrounding rock over time was weathered away pipes are also a volcanic landform we see although they are rare they are conduits that originated in the mantle at depths exceeding 150 kilometers kimberlite pipes is where we can find diamonds and they are examples of these rare features in the next video we will explore in a little more detail the tectonic setting of volcanoes or where on earth we expect to find these destructive processes

howdy everyone in this video we're going to be talking about the tectonic setting of volcanoes or where on earth we can find these things happening here's a nice figure showing the plate tectonic setting of volcanoes most of the earth's volcanic activity occurs at mid-ocean ridges which are found at divergent plate boundaries remember divergent plate boundaries from our plate tectonic module well all the information you learned in that module is going to be useful in this video the remainder occurs at convergent plate boundaries where we see most of our volcanoes and those are only at convergent plate boundaries above subduction zones and then we have a smaller amount that occur at hot spots which we've also talked about now i really like this slide because it very nicely summarizes all the plate tectonic settings of volcanoes but i'm going to get into more detail on each of these settings here in a moment but convergent margins have volcanoes only where we have subduction zones and these volcanoes produce and acidic magma which produce explosive eruptions and tend to lead to the formation of composite volcanoes some examples of that are mount saint helens mount vesuvius and mount fuji now divergent margins we mainly see volcanoes associated with mid-ocean ridges however we do have some on land and rift zones most of the volcanoes on divergent margins produce basaltic magma which often lead to quiet non-explosive eruptions that we call effusive and these types of eruptions more commonly produced shield volcanoes some examples of that are the volcanoes in iceland and the volcanic activity seen all along the mid-ocean ridge now another plate tectonic setting that we can see volcanoes are at hot spots but i separate these into two different kinds hot spots over oceanic crust in hot spots over continental crust hot spots over oceanic crust form due to a relatively stationary mantle plume and these result in basaltic magma and form shield volcanoes now these volcanoes are characterized by usually quiet non-explosive eruptions or those effusive eruptions great example of that is the hawaiian islands now hot spots underneath continental crust behave very differently they also form due to a relatively stationary mantle plume but instead of basaltic magma we have rhyolytic magma and these can result in caldera eruptions which produce some of the most explosive volcanoes on earth an example of that is yellowstone volcanoes at convergent margins only occur where we have subduction zones they are formed because of the volatile rich magmas that are generated by the melting due to the addition of volatiles these margins produce most of the volcanoes that we see on the earth's surface the magma produced here is mostly and acidic in composition or intermediate which can lead to explosive eruptions and composite volcanoes examples again include mount saint helens mount vesuvius and mount fuji now volcanoes at divergent plate boundaries are mostly found along mid-ocean ridges lavas erupted at mid-ocean ridges produces 70 of the earth's surface this is where that hot mantle material rises and leads to decompression melting which generates basaltic magma and eventually forms new ocean floor they produce mostly quiet non-explosive eruptions or effusive eruptions and form shield volcanoes not all diverging volcanoes are over oceanic crust though some are formed over continental crust like mount kilimanjaro and the continental rift zone of east africa continental rifts produce magma from decompression melting in the mantle but then felsic magma is produced by the melting of continental crusts which we sometimes call heat transfer melting oceanic hot spots are the result of a stationary mantle plume that produces basaltic magma by decompression melting and they form seamounts and shield volcanoes they are characterized by quiet non-explosive eruptions like the example of the hawaiian islands remember these hot spots can be stationary for very long periods of time like shown here under the pacific plate for over 80 million years right off the coast of the big island of hawaii is where we have the current hotspot sitting today but as the pacific ocean pacific plate has moved over top of this it has produced the entire chain of the hawaiian islands the hawaiian ridge shown on the sea floor and even the emperor sea mounts when we see sea mounts or remnants of shield volcanoes preserved on the earth's surface like in the hawaiian islands we can actually infer which way the plate is moving because the plate will always appear to be moving towards the older islands as shown here and this is an important concept to remember as you prepare for the quiz now hotspots are those plumes of hot mantle that is rising from the core mantle boundary they don't just occur over oceanic crust though we have them occurring underneath continental crust as well the important thing to remember about hot spots is that they form independent of plate boundaries hot spots underneath continental crust are also the result of a relatively stationary mantle plume except these produce more viscous rhyolitic magma similar to the melting we see at continental rips where we have decompression melting of the mantle below and as it rises and pulls underneath the continent it results in additional heat transfer magma that continues to add silica to the melt forming these ultra viscous rhyolitic magmas and these can result in the most explosive eruptions on earth one example of that is sitting quietly for now underneath yellowstone here you can see the hot spot underneath the north american plate that is currently sitting underneath yellowstone the last eruption was 0.6 million years ago or 600 000 years ago but you can see here that there have been many eruptions and we even believe that the columbia river basalt that we talked about earlier was one explosive or a series of these eruptions underneath the hot spot now just like the pacific plate the north american plate appears to move in the direction where the calderas are aging here's a map of those hot spots again remember hot spots do not occur at plate boundaries they are thought to be caused by those hot mantle plumes and those hot spots remain stationary for long periods of geologic time here i'm just going to show some recent eruptions that were associated with those platonic settings that we've talked about here's mount cinebung in indonesia in an eruption that occurred last year here's picaya erupting in guatemala here's an eruption from last year with mount merapi in indonesia you can see here that it is very prominently cone-shaped because this is a composite volcano sitting over a convergent subduction zone eruptions do not just occur on the ring of fire here's an eruption from last year of mount aetnan italy europe's most active volcano here's an eruption on st vincent in the caribbean last year here's a photo showing lava flows from a volcano on in iceland just last year we even have volcanoes all the way down in antarctica here's mount erebus erupting last year here's kilauea on the big island of hawaii which is probably the world's most active volcano which has been continually erupting for the last 60 years this photo was taken in 2017 but it really looks the same today so hopefully you understand why studying volcanoes are so important over 450 million people worldwide live near active volcanoes which is about nine percent of earth's population many major population centers are located near active or dormant volcanoes attempting to predict volcanic eruptions and evacuating populations is really our only option because we can't stop or prevent the eruptions from happening here's mount rainier mount rainier is only 54 miles away from over half a million people seattle washington here's mexico city which is near two active volcanoes it's only 43 miles from nine million people here's one of those volcanoes erupting in 2015 near mexico city interrupted 30 times in less than 24 hours the mountain's name means smoking mountain aztec and has 15 major eruptions since 1519. here's that eruption just last year mount fuji is only 62 miles from 12 million people in tokyo japan ninety percent of the world's most dangerous volcanoes occur in indonesia the philippines japan mexico and ethiopia in 2020 there were 72 eruptions from 67 different volcanoes and just last year there were 78 eruptions from 74 different volcanoes 30 of them or new eruptions so far this year 47 volcanoes have erupted or have continued erupting and there are about 139 active volcanoes worldwide with about 18 to 20 considered to be currently in a highly active state now these volcanoes come with a whole host of hazards from the primary eruption itself like lava flows and pyroclastic flows which we will talk about both in the next video they also include volcanic bombs nue ardentes which are the incandescent cloud of gas ash and lava fragments ejected from a volcano that looks like glowing ash ash deposits and clouds and even poisonous gas but there are also secondary effects of a volcanic eruption that can be just as hazardous such as mud flows that we call lahars and we will talk about that later debris flows in avalanches floods fires contamination of surface and groundwater and even acid rain and in the next and final two videos of this module we will explore some of these volcanic hazards in more detail

howdy everyone and welcome to the last two videos of this module hang in there you're almost there in this video in the next video we're going to be talking about volcanic hazards in this video in particular we're going to focus on lava flow's empire classic flows i'm going to show a few videos from vole film which is hosted on vimeo i highly recommend checking out the additional videos on there if you're interested it really shows how powerful our earth can be so we'll start with lava flows and we've learned a great deal about lava flows we actually had a whole video that talked about the different types of lava flows we can have now lava flows can flow tens of kilometers from their source especially those basalt lawns they can move at speeds exceeding 19 miles per hour down steep slope although they are usually much slower than that and scientists can often predict their paths so it's usually the immovable property that ends up being destroyed here i'm going to show a video from that vimeo channel on lava floats many volcanoes are rock molten rock called lava extremely hot much hotter than an oven or boiling water some eruptions produce runny lavas that can form flows like red hot rivers which can travel many kilometers in other eruptions the lavas ooze slowly out of the volcanoes to form piles of lava called domes or short thick flows lava's dangerous to approach because of its intense heat blocks of lava can roll off the front of flows buildings and vegetation can be set on fire generating smoke and poor air quality explosions can occur when lava comes into contact with fuel in 2002 a lava flow traveled through the city of goma in the democratic republic of congo many people were killed or injured in an explosion of a gas station other violent explosions can occur when lava interacts with water snow or vegetation the heat of lava can melt snow or ice and cause flooding and mud flows which can be widespread and destructive some lavas can flow faster than a person can run but normally lava travels slowly enough for people to move out of its way sometimes there's time to remove possessions in 2014 lava threatened a wine business in fogo cabo verde but the equipment and the wine was moved before the lava's arrival heed the authorities advice on when to evacuate and whether there's time to take belongings lava can bury roads and cut off escape routes making it important to evacuate in good time farmland buried under lava can be unproductive for years decades or longer in some cases lava flows around buildings or even through them but some lava flows are so powerful they can knock buildings down the sticky slow-moving lavas that form domes can be very dangerous as they can suddenly collapse to form deadly avalanches of hot rock gas and ash called pyroclastic flows lavas can take months to cool sometimes a fragile cooled crust can form over a molten interior so people should not attempt to cross recent flows lava deltas can suddenly collapse and trigger explosions and scalding waves scientists can often successfully forecast the direction of the lavas if you're advised to evacuate do not return until you're told it's safe although dangerous lava eruptions can be beautiful so they can attract spectators heed the advice of local authorities to avoid dangers and view lavas safely fire classic flows are another really important volcanic hazard to keep in mind they are a mixture of hot gases infused with incandescent ash and larger lava fragments that we sometimes call nue or dantes pyroplastic flows are propelled by gravity and they move similarly to a snow avalanche the material is propelled from the vent at very high speeds and can exceed 60 miles per hour pyroclastic flows are typically generated by the collapse of tall eruption columns now pyroclastic flows impact zones closer to the volcano but they have been known to impact up to 20 kilometers away a surge is a small amount of ash that separates from the main body of a pyroclastic flow and occasionally these surges have enough force to knock over buildings and move automobiles in 1902 the town of st pierre was destroyed by a pyre classic flow from mount pele pompeii was entombed beneath a layer of volcanic ash and pumice which we'll talk about pompeii in the next video here's some photos of the destruction of saint pierre in 1902 from the eruption of mount pele you can see that it completely devastated the town of saint pierre because of that pyroclastic flow that literally destroys anything in its path here i'm going to show another video on pirate classic flows i tend to show a lot of videos within these lectures because i feel like seeing these processes in action makes a lot more sense than just looking at words on a screen [Music] pyroclastic flows are one of the most deadly of volcanic hazards they are rapidly moving avalanches of hot rock dust and gas that flow down the sides of a volcano and into surrounding valleys they can climb up and over ridges and high ground they are dangerous because they flow much faster than a person can run and often faster than a car so for those in their path there's little chance of escape what makes them especially lethal and devastating is that they're extremely hot during the day they appear grey and ashy but at night they can be seen glowing red hot they destroy and burn anything in their way death or severe injury is certain for those caught by a pyroclastic flow there are two main ways pyroclastic flows may form sometimes a volcano explodes and forms a fountain of hot pulverized rock and gas that first rapidly rises into the sky and then falls back forming pyroclastic flows which race down the sides of the volcano other times instead of an explosion sticky lava oozes out of a volcano and piles up around the summit [Music] pyroclastic flows can then form by parts of the lava collapsing although pyroclastic flows normally move down valleys extremely hot fast-moving billowing clouds form above them which can spill out of valleys this means that even people on high ground are not safe pyroclastic flows normally travel to distances of 5 to 10 kilometers from the volcano summit but in the biggest eruptions they reach much more than 20 kilometers volcanoes that haven't erupted for many decades or even centuries may appear peaceful but when they awaken the eruptions are often very large and explosive scientists can detect that a volcano is re-awakening and are able to provide some warning or advice to evacuate which is the only protection from pyroclastic flows here's a photo of some of the destruction of pompeii from a interruption of mount vesuvius it was completely devastating and suspected that a pyroclastic flow is what ultimately destroyed and killed everybody there their bodies were then entombed in ash and preserved for decades to come in the next video we'll look at other hazards like ash and tephra landslides lahars and volcanic gases

howdy everyone and welcome to the final video of module 5. in this video we're going to be exploring the rest of the volcanic hazards although as you saw a couple videos ago there are even more than just what we mentioned in this class in this video we're going to be exploring the hazards of ash and tefra landslides lahars and volcanic gases volcanic ash and tephra are significant hazards that can impact communities hundreds even thousands of miles away from a volcano for years after an eruption your textbook talks about the volcanic ash as a hazard to airplanes because jet engines can be damaged when flying through a cloud of volcanic ash a recent example of ash's global impact happened in 2010 this occurred when there was an eruption of one of iceland's volcanoes which i won't even try to pronounce created a thick plume of ash all over europe straining hundreds of thousands of travelers for several weeks ash has also been known to damage car engines as well but probably the worst part of volcanic ash is that it can bury entire landscapes and kill crops making farmland unusable for years even decades after an eruption it is also extremely harmful to breathe in and can not only cause respiratory distress by damaging the lungs but can even cause death ash is very heavy especially when wet and can cause roof collapse ash particles can be ejected high into the atmosphere and block sunlight causing temporary atmosphere cooling a famous example of this occurred in 1815 after the violent eruption of mount timbura in indonesia and this was known as the year without a summer it even caused snowfall on the east coast of the united states in the summer again ash is an extremely significant hazard with global implications for long periods of time here i'm going to show a video of the impact of volcanic ash explosive volcanic eruptions send clouds full of rock and fine grained ash to great heights in the atmosphere ash has spread over large areas by the wind gradually the rocks and ash fall to the ground with the largest material falling closest to the volcano near the vent falling rocks can cause death and injury people caught in a shower of rock should protect their heads and seek refuge indoors that the largest rocks can break through roofs and hot rocks can cause fires people for kilometers to hundreds of kilometers downwind of an eruption are at risk from volcanic ash both during the eruption and when ash is stirred up by the wind or human activities for months or even years later volcanic ash is an irritant to the skin eyes and lungs and can affect breathing children the elderly and those with chronic heart or lung conditions are especially vulnerable and should avoid exposure as it may trigger conditions such as asthma layers of ash can bury land and buildings roofs may collapse under thick layers of ash especially if the ash gets wet the safest option is to evacuate areas near the volcano but if caught seek shelter and sturdy buildings avoiding those with flat roofs agriculture can be impacted through damage and burial of crops and machinery and injury or death of livestock through ingestion of ash and restricted access to clean food and water water supplies and wastewater systems can be disrupted through damage blockage or contamination all forms of transportation may be disrupted a stop during an asphalt and for days afterwards heavy ash falls can reduce visibility and make roads slippery vehicles can break down as engines are clogged with ash airports railways and ports are commonly shut flights may be cancelled because airborne ash can cause catastrophic damage to aircraft scientists and authorities can provide information on what areas will be most affected by volcanic ash fall for those who live near a volcano having an emergency kit will help in the event of an eruption if outdoors or if your indoor environment is ashy wear a face mask designed to block fine particles holding cloth over your nose and mouth will provide limited protection skin should be covered contact lenses removed and eyes protected if advised to evacuate follow all instructions and do not return until advised that it's safe take care when cleaning up ash as deaths and injury due to heart attacks and falls are possible thick deposits can be heavy and ash can easily become airborne making breathing difficult many people live in areas frequently impacted by asphalt preparation and coordinated organized cleanup operations can help you live alongside volcanoes landslides by definition are large masses of wet or dry rock and soil that fall slide or flow under the force of gravity they are common hazards on volcanic cones due to their steep tall slopes volcanic landslides can be triggered by one or more of the following conditions they can be triggered by the intrusion of magma into the volcano the magma releases volcanic gases that can be dissolved in the groundwater creating a hot acidic hydrothermal system that weakens the rock they can also be triggered by an explosive eruption or a large earthquake directly beneath a volcano or nearby heavier long-lived rainfall can also trigger a landslide by saturating the ground not only are landslides deadly by destroying things in their path but they can also trigger an eruption by removing a large part of a volcano in a landslide it can decrease the pressure on the magmatic system below allowing it to explode outwards like we saw happen at mount st helens which i will talk about more later on in this video volcanic landslides especially the collapse of a volcanic cone can trigger tsunami if they occur underwater or travel offshore this happened dramatically in 1883 when the northern half of a volcano on the indonesian island of krakatoa plunged into the sunda strait creating a tsunami that was more than 100 feet in height 36 000 people were killed along the coast of java and sumatra as a result a lahar is a mud flow that occurs on an active or inactive volcano and can be very deadly impacting communities tens of kilometers away they occur when volcanic debris becomes saturated with water and rapidly moves down steep volcanic slopes and they generally follow the path of rivers and streams some lahars are triggered when rising magma gets close to the surface of an ice-covered volcano like we saw with mount saint helens causing large volumes of snow and ice to suddenly melt mixing with ash and debris others happen when heavy rains saturate weathered volcanic deposits this means that lahars can occur even when a volcano is not erupting when mount saint helens erupted several lahars were generated racing down river valleys at speeds of over 20 miles per hour these floods are not just water but more like a slurry of wet cement carrying solid debris that can reach the size of a house in 1985 another deadly lahar was triggered in colombia during the eruption of nevado del rues in the andes mountain the hot pyroclastic material melted the snow and ice and sent a slurry of ash and debris down three major river valleys reaching speeds of 60 miles per hour and killing 25 000 people mount rainier in washington is often considered to be america's most dangerous volcano because like nevada del ruiz it is covered in a thick layer of year-round snow and ice and it has more than a hundred thousand people living in the valleys around it many of these homes are even built on old deposits of these lahars a future eruption or even a period of heavier than usual rainfall might produce lahars here that can be just as destructive here's a figure showing a lahar off of a volcano that is erupting you can see here that the lahars follow the valleys of rivers and streams and they can occur in very very thick amounts covering homes in their entirety a map showing mount rainier you can see all the river valleys along mount rainier contain lots of cities such as electron or team even all the way to tacoma the yellows and reds shown on this map are areas that would be impacted by lahar here's a video that demonstrates the hazards of lahars a little bit better than just reading words on a screen a major danger on many volcanoes comes from floods of water mixed with volcanic debris these floods are called lahars lahars are more destructive than a normal flood because they contain large amounts of rock ash mud and debris boulders swept along by the lahar can sometimes be the size of a car they can form very quickly and flow down the volcano into the surrounding valleys often at high speeds several lahars often occur in quick succession lahars are a major cause of death and volcanic eruptions they can travel great distances many kilometers or even many tens of kilometers so communities far from the volcano can still be in great danger there are many causes of lahars a very common cause is if there's heavy rain an eruption can cover the sides of a volcano with loose rocks and ash vegetation in soil which normally absorbs the rain and prevents floods can be destroyed by the eruption adding to the problem when it rains heavily rot ash and debris are easily swept into the water forming lahars the rocks and debris give the lahar extra destructive energy and often the flows move much faster than someone can run some volcanoes are covered in glass airs in ice or snow eruptions of hot rocks can melt the ice or snow rapidly to form births of huge volumes of water that form lahars lahars can occur at any time during a volcanic eruption but they can also happen many years afterwards fortunately there can be warnings given about lahars if heavy rain is forecast then the chances of allah increases for those places threatened evacuation is the only option if there's not enough time to evacuate then people can protect themselves by immediately leaving valleys and going to high ground hiding in buildings is not safe as large lahars can destroy buildings or flow into them but the upper floors of a strong building may offer some protection if there's no alternative volcanoes can also emit poisonous gases endangering humans and livestock even when they're not actively erupting the most common gas emitted is water vapor and it's not exactly harmful to breathe but it can be released at extremely hot temperatures and can be deadly if you come into contact with it carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide are the most toxic gases released carbon dioxide can be a silent killer because it is odorless and colorless it is denser than air so it does not rise rapidly and can be breathed in without the knowledge of its presence depriving the brain of oxygen a tragic example of this occurred in lake naios in cameroon in 1986. nios is a deep lake along the flanks of a dormant volcano however gases like carbon dioxide from this volcano were still being emitted beneath the lake scientists believe that a landslide into lake niles stirred the lake enough to release a large cloud of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which suffocated 1746 people and 3 500 livestock in nearby towns and villages here is another video that shows the hazards of volcanic gases the molten rock stored beneath volcanoes called magma contains dissolved gases which are released during eruptions or emitted when the volcanoes quiet escaping through the soil hot springs lakes and gas vents called funerals there are several types of volcanic gas some form a cloud that looks like fog known as vog other times the gases are invisible the most common gas is water vapor or steam steam plumes can often be seen reaching high into the atmosphere above volcanoes there can be substantial amounts of other gases which can sometimes be toxic to people and animals and damage crops and property carbon dioxide is colorless and odourless this means you can't see it or smell it it's heavier than air so it can collect in low-lying areas lakes and confined spaces even short exposure to too much carbon dioxide can cause unconsciousness and death other gases contain sulfur these are colorless but some have a strong smell like rotten eggs sulfurous gases irritate your skin eyes nose and throat the smell can act as a warning but it disappears at high concentrations where it becomes highly toxic causing unconsciousness and death long range hazards can form when gases react with rain water to form acid rain and sunlight in the atmosphere to create particles which can cause health impacts even hundreds of kilometers from the volcano large eruptions can produce such enormous amounts of gas that the world's climate can be affected for years as the gas acts to block out some of the sun's energy persistent plumes of volcanic gas may cause long-term damage to agriculture and to people's health however normally volcanic gases become harmless as they are diluted quickly in the air scientists monitor volcanic gases during and between eruptions monitoring can allow for warnings when gas levels are potentially hazardous mount vesuvius which is a composite volcano found in italy erupted explosively and suddenly in the year 79. for hundreds of years prior to the eruption the volcano laid dormant with people and vineyards flourishing all along its slopes in less than 24 hours however the entire city of pompeii was entombed in ash and pumice scientists believe that during the first day of the eruption that it rained ash and pumice at a rate of five to six inches per hour causing most of the roofs in pompeii to collapse and then suddenly a surge of a pyroclastic flow killed those who had somehow survived the initial ash fall causing their remains to be buried so quickly and preserve their tragic ending for centuries to come now i mentioned mount st helens as an example of many hazards that we've talked about in this module so let's just go into detail exactly what went on in mount st helens and during the eruption in 1980 this figure shows really nicely how the mount st helens evolved leading up to that eruption prior to the eruption the magma chamber was considered empty however over time that magma chamber inflated as the magma rose from below creating a bulge on the side of the mountain that even scientists were monitoring and could see then weakened by an earthquake the north slope slipped this released pressure on the magma chamber causing the dissolved gases to expand and blast out sideways causing the eruption itself here's a photo that was taken a week before that eruption showing that giant bulge on the side of the mountain pretty obvious to see that something was going on beneath this mountain here's a time lapse photograph of the may 18 corruption in 1980 in the top left you can see the mountain is relatively quiet followed beneath that an image showing the landslide where the northern slope of this mountain collapsed and that released pressure that was on the magma chamber allowing the gas and magma to explode outwards that you can see in the remaining photographs a photo showing that mount st helen's eruption you can see here a very large eruptive column with ash being ejected miles into the atmosphere here's a map showing the damage from mount st helen's eruption you can see here that they were lateral blast deposits shown in this purple color or brownish purple color that really covered a huge extensive area surrounding the volcano itself now keep in mind the scale of this map in red this is where we have those pyroclastic flows that we talked about in the last video that impacted large area as well but stayed relatively concentrated closer to the volcano itself but you'll notice the debris avalanches which were the landslide deposits reached much farther away from the volcano and then those mud flow deposits which we call those lahars traveled even further even off of this map completely here's another photo showing mount st helens before the eruption this is looking at its east flank and here's the same view of the volcano after the eruption you can see here that the mountain has been dramatically changed here's a side by side before and after that eruption not just the mountain has been completely changed but the area surrounding the mountain has also been changed you can see here that the mountain has lost a significant portion of its height but if you look at the front of this image you'll notice before the eruption we had vast forests or after the eruption you can see that those trees are no longer there they have been blown over from the blasts and then covered with a thick layer of ash here's a pre-eruption view of spirit lake notice the snow and ice and the vast forests that surround this lake here's a view of spirit lake after the eruption here's a photo showing the fallen timber from 1980 eruption in bouncing helens you can see that trees here in the forest that surrounded the mountain were treated almost like matchsticks and blown over like they were nothing and here's a map showing the ash fallout from mount st helens in red this is where we had the most significant ash fall with thicknesses of up to five centimeters however we had a large portion of the united states that was impacted from this ash fall shown in purple and these areas had up to 1.25 centimeters of ash here's a photo showing some of that ash fallout now we also had lahars we had almost every volcanic hazard that you can imagine with mount saint helens remember our lahars those volcanic mud flows here you can see on the left them the lahars washing out bridges and there on the right is showing you the deposits 20 years later showing that there were huge logs that were carried within this lahar not just water ash and debris but everything that it came into contact with it continued to carry down hill here's a photo showing the impact of the lahar you see white arrows here on the tree trunks that are showing how high the lahar actually got and there's a person circled for scale here's mount st helens 35 years after the eruption this was taken in 2015 and really looks similar today completely changed the landscape surrounding that mountain for decades and decades to come now here in this image you can see what mount st helens looks like today it's peaceful for now but it is still rumbling so what can we do to minimize the impact of these destructive natural processes well volcano monitoring is critical especially for the millions of people who live near one there are three main ways we can monitor volcanoes and infer that an eruption may be likely in the near future scientists study changes in patterns of earthquakes and in general we see a sharp increase in seismic activity followed by a period of quiet and this has been shown to be a predictor of many volcanic eruptions but not always scientists also monitor the volcanic cone for inflation or deflation by using remote sensing devices just like we saw with mount st helens as a magma chamber begins to fill up it can expand and inflate the volcano prior to an eruption and thirdly scientists also monitor the changes in the amount and the composition of gases released by the volcano this monitoring has revealed that some volcanoes show an increase in sulfur dioxide leading up to an eruption of course even with all this monitoring in place a volcano can still erupt with little to no warning and residents who live near one should have a plan in the event of an unexpected eruption this concludes module 5. you should now have all the information you need to complete the participation activity i highly recommend that you review this chapter in your textbook prior to taking the quiz but as always please reach out to me if you have any questions this also concludes the modules that will be included in your first exam modules 1 2 3 four and this module five will all be included in your exam i highly recommend that you review the participation activity questions and the quizzes for all five modules prior to taking your exam but as always please never hesitate to reach out if you need any further assistance
