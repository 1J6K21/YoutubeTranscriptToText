howdy everyone and welcome to the first module of principles of geology throughout this entire module we're going to be exploring just kind of a basic introduction to geology and there's going to be several videos that we're going to run through the first of which is going to be on the science of geology so geology is the science of processes related to the composition the structure and the history of the earth and its life it's one of the most if not the most interdisciplinary science it relies on chemistry it relies on physics and it even relies on biology now we can usually split up geology into two different fields we call this physical geology and historical geology physical geology examines materials composing earth and seeks to understand the many processes that operate beneath and on the surface of our planet this is the geology that we're going to spend most of the semester on but there's also a second field called historical geology and historical geology seeks an understanding of the origin of earth and its development through time and we will be talking a little bit about historical geology throughout the semester now why should we study geology in the first place well there are many reasons why the first being we all use resources from the environment i think that's a pretty big one resources aren't extremely important part of geology they include water soil metallic and non-metallic minerals and even energy here's a powerful graphic of how much we as americans actually consume 3.5 million pounds of minerals metals and fuels in one lifetime and that's just one american where do you think all of these resources are coming from they're coming from our home our planet earth so it's important that we understand how these processes work on our planet because we definitely rely on it very much as you can see every american born will need almost 1400 pounds of copper over 20 000 pounds of clays and these are all things you probably don't even think about but we use a ton of these in our everyday life we use almost 30 000 pounds of salt just one person in a lifetime almost 800 pounds of zinc 1.55 million pounds of stone sand and gravel and we love our fossil fuels still we use almost 82 000 gallons of petroleum in one lifetime just one person we use over 65 000 pounds of cement we use 1.279 troy ounces of gold which is which is a pretty significant amount of gold if you think about it we use almost 600 000 pounds of coal even still to this day although that is diminishing we use almost 22 000 pounds of phosphate rock almost five thousand pounds of bauxite and bauxite is just kind of where we get most of our aluminum from we use almost 900 pounds of lead almost 33 000 pounds of iron ore and we use almost 6 million cubic feet of natural gas and almost 50 000 pounds of other various minerals and metals so again we rely on natural resources so much um and even more going on into the future so what's another reason why we study geology well we all depend on a healthy environment people influence geologic processes we humans can dramatically influence geologic processes for example landslides and river flooding occur naturally but the magnitude and frequency of these events can be affected significantly by human activities just by clearing forests building cities and constructing roads and dams unfortunately natural systems do not always adjust to our artificial changes in ways that we can anticipate among the most important environmental issues linked to human activities is global climate change as we will learn later on in this semester climate is naturally variable however that natural variability can be overshadowed by the influence of humans especially those associated with burning fossil fuels one example of why we depend on such a healthy environment here we're going to talk about what's considered to be the largest marine oil spill in history in 2010 the bp deep water horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico this began on april 20th in 2010 and after several failed attempts to contain the flow it was declared sealed on september 19 2010 that is 152 days reports nearly two years later indicated that the well site was still leaking the full extent of the environmental impact is still unknown even today the spill area hosts over 8 000 species of marine life the spill waters contained 40 times more polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons which are known carcinogens and chemicals that are harmful to humans and marine life it was the most concentrated near the louisiana coast but levels were still high off alabama mississippi and florida the oil contained about 40 percent methane which can potentially suffocate marine life and create dead zones where oxygen becomes depleted not just the spill was toxic though the cleanup was also toxic the oil dispersant that was used was released in unprecedented amounts with the intent on making the oil more easily biodegradable however this caused oil that would normally rise to the surface to be emulsified and remain suspended in the water and on the sea floor where it has been impacting the entire food chain from tiny zooplankton crabs fish to migratory birds as far away as minnesota and finally the third reason of why we should study geology although there's probably many many more than just three reasons natural hazards affect everyone natural hazards are part of living on earth every day they impact millions of people and are responsible for enormous amounts of damage and losses of life geologists study volcanoes tsunami earthquakes and landslides of course these hazards are natural processes and there's little we can do to prevent them sometimes they only become hazards when people try to live near where these processes occur one example of a natural disaster that impacted many people is the 2011 tohuku earthquake and tsunami this occurred due to a magnitude 9.1 underwater mega thrust earthquake the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in japan and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record keeping began the main shaking lasted about six minutes it moved the main island of japan eight feet to the east it shifted the earth on its axis up to 10 inches the entire earth and it increased the earth's rotational speed by 1.8 microseconds per day that's a very powerful earthquake this earthquake triggered tsunami waves up to 133 feet and these waves traveled at speeds of up to 435 miles per hour that's about the speed of a jet plane and these waves traveled up to six miles inland some of these residents only had eight to ten minutes of warning and hundreds of evacuation sites were even washed away the official numbers released last year reported nineteen 19747 deaths over 6 000 injured and 2556 people are still missing the tsunami also caused the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster which has now become another environmental disaster completely that we could spend a whole lot of time talking about so obviously geology is very important to study but the reason why it's becoming even more important is because of human population growth human population growth is the number one environmental problem today the endless steady growth in the consumption of earth's finite resources is the centerpiece of the u.s and world economies this growth however is producing huge increases in the human population and obliterating vital resources in modern periods of time to threaten the survival of our societies and perhaps some would argue our species it is important to remember that we are consuming the earth's finite natural resources and they are not indeed infinite so what is the population bomb it's the exponential growth of the human population exponential growth of humans means that the number of people added to the population each year is not constant rather it's a constant percentage of the current population that is added each year now you don't need to memorize any of these calculations i just kind of wanted to put it into context so you understand how quickly the population is growing it's growing at an exponential rate and how we calculate an exponential growth calculation is we use this funky formula n equals n naught e to the k times t n is the future value and not is the present value e is just a constant of 2.71828 k is equal to the rate of increase so this is a decimal instead of a percentage and t is the total number of years over which growth is to be calculated again you do not need to memorize this this is just adding context to why human population growth is the number one environmental problem so let's calculate based on that equation how much we will spend on a 30-year mortgage on a hundred thousand dollars at a five percent interest per year okay this is this is going to be a similar calculation that we can do with population also so a hundred thousand dollars is our current value e is that constant number .05 is our interest rate it's a decimal not a percentage and we want to know how much it will increase in 30 years so t is 30. so if you plug that into the calculator and you can do that yourself if you don't believe me it's going to come out to be over 448 000 that's how much you're going to spend on a 30-year mortgage for a 100 000 house at a 5 interest rate and that's why these interest rates today that are rapidly increasing are very very important to keep in mind because you can spend a lot more than you really think just over the amount of time and interest now apply that to human population because earth's population is increasing exponentially many scientists are concerned that it will be impossible to keep up with the current demand on our planet's resources the exponential growth has two important aspects it has the growth rate again you don't need to memorize any of this the growth rate is measured as a percentage and sometimes it's it's referred to as the capital letter g the doubling time or capital d is the time it takes for whatever is growing to double so how long will it take for the population to double and a general rule of thumb is that the doubling time equals 70 divided by the growth rate in 1962 the world population growth rate peaked at 2.2 percent now if the growth rate remained constant at 2.2 percent then we would expect the doubling time to equal about 32 years because 70 divided by 2.2 percent is going to give us 32 years that means it would only take 32 years for the world population to double that's pretty scary and that means that the population would double every 32 years if the rate remained constant even very modest rates of growth eventually produce large increases in whatever is growing today the doubling time of the world population is closer to 44 years so our rate has decreased a little bit but that's still a staggering number every 44 years we expect our population to double some studies even suggest that the present population is already above the carrying capacity of the planet carrying capacity is the maximum number of people earth can hold without causing environmental degradation that reduces the ability of the planet to support the population just think about that some scientists think we are already above the carrying capacity it's not all bad news though regarding human population growth for the first time since the mid 1900s the rate of increase in the human population is decreasing this is likely related to the education of women the decision to marry later in life and the availability of modern birth control methods however until the growth rate is zero the population will continue to grow the fertility rate necessary for replacement is 2.1 this means each woman would need to birth on average 2.1 children in order to keep the human population growth at zero over 20 countries today which are mostly located in western europe have achieved a fertility rate of 2.1 or less this means the few future population growth will occur almost entirely in developing countries that are already struggling to support their current populations this has caused multiple environmental issues such as climate change from burning fossil fuels deforestation due to the increased need for agriculture which causes soil erosion water and air pollution and that occurs on almost every continent mining resources such as metals coal and petroleum come with a whole host of problems development of both groundwater and surface water resources results in a loss of and damage to many environments across the world even locally causing sinkholes on a positive note we have learned a great deal concerning the relationship between environmental degradation and resource utilization and innovative plans are underway for sustainable developments especially when it comes to water and energy let's hope that science can keep up with reality because we are in an environmental crisis now a system is defined as many parts of the universe we select to study most systems contain several component parts that mutually adjust the function as a whole where changes in one compartment brings changes in other compartments this is true about the earth the components of our global system are the geosphere the hydrosphere the atmosphere the cryosphere and the biosphere the geosphere or sometimes it's referred to as the lithosphere consists of the entire solid portion of earth the hydrosphere contains all the liquid water on earth in the global oceans and fresh surface waters and groundwater the atmosphere consists of the gaseous envelope that surrounds our entire planet the cryosphere consists of all frozen water on earth and glaciers and permafrost and of course our biosphere contains all plant and animal life including us oftentimes these spheres overlap for example a wet mud and earthworm found on the edge of a lake would be considered to be part of many spheres the wet mud is part of the geosphere the earthworm is part of the biosphere and the lake is part of the hydrosphere so understanding earth's systems and their changes is absolutely critical to solving environmental problems now how can we analyze changes in a system steady state is established when the input equals the output such as an example a our planet is roughly a steady state system with respect to energy incoming solar radiation is roughly balanced by outgoing radiation from the earth the second type of change occurs when the output is greater than the input for example we are using more of our planet's resources such as fossil fuels or even groundwater than is being replenished this causes our reserves or our stock to be depleted and is dangerous the third type of change occurs when the input is greater than the output this can be dangerous as well especially when referring to pollution for example we are polluting our lakes and rivers with heavy metals faster than what is being taken out this causes the amount of toxins to grow over time now getting into a little bit about what makes geology geology i like to talk about uniformitarianism james hutton is referred to as the father of geology by some folks it is a key concept in the earth sciences today and it quite simply implies that the processes we observe today also operated in the past such as the flow of water and rivers the formation and movements of glaciers landslides waves earthquakes and so on we can infer that for as long as earth has had an atmosphere ocean and continents similar to those of today the same processes were operating present human activity is part of the key to understanding the future for example if we construct a dam on a river a number of changes would occur sediment that moved down the river to the ocean before would now be trapped in the reservoir beaches would be deprived of sediment from the river and may increase coastal erosion this may even start to affect coastal animals such as sand crabs that use the sand the dam would also change the entire hydrology of the river and would block fish from migrating upstream a chain of reactions now what do you think the impact of the industrial revolution and the burning of fossil fuels has on the environment a chain of reactions this brings me to environmental unity where one action causes others in a chain of actions it is an important prison principle in the prediction of changes in the earth system just like uniformitarianism but talking about the present is the key to the future

howdy everyone and thank you for continuing on with our first module in this video we're going to be talking about the scientific method which you've probably heard about before whether it be in high school or maybe another science class on campus the nature of scientific inquiry is that science is a process of producing knowledge based on making observations and developing explanations and assumes the natural world behaves consistently and predictably so essentially to begin the scientific inquiry we must make an observation it is sunny today this is an example of an observation the goal of science is to discover patterns in nature and use that knowledge to make predictions now we also use facts with observations to begin our scientific inquiry plants will begin to grow on volcanic rocks in hawaii within 20 years of when the rock calls from molten rock this is an example of a fact but this statement does not yet explain how or why this is just the beginning of our scientific inquiry data are essential to science and the development of those scientific theories how or why things happen are explained using hypothesis theory and scientific methods a hypothesis is a tentative or untested explanation and a hypothesis must fit observations and be testable if i complete all the work on time in each module then i will do better on the exams this is an example of a hypothesis and it is testable i highly recommend that you test this one out now a theory is a well-tested and widely accepted view that the scientific community agrees that best explains certain observable facts objects thrown in the air will always fall back down the earth due to a force called gravity this is an example of a theory and the scientific method is the process by which researchers raise questions gather data and formulate and test scientific hypotheses now the use of scientific inquiry to solve a particular environmental problem often provides a series of potential solutions consistent with the scientific findings the chosen solution is a reflection of our value system often our observation of a problem or curiosity about the world and how it works is the first step in the scientific method we then make a hypothesis that is intended to be a possible answer to a scientific question we design an experiment to test our hypothesis that involves data collection organization and analysis based on our results we then draw a conclusion the conclusion is then compared with the hypothesis where we either accept it or we reject it depending on the results the entire scientific method could start all over again if the hypothesis withstands the testing of sufficient number of experiments it may be accepted as a theory new evidence often disproves existing hypotheses or theories and science is constantly evolving in the next video we will explore the origins of the universe the solar system and the earth itself

howdy everyone and welcome to the lecture video on the origin and early evolution of the earth in module one the universe began about 13.7 billion years ago with what we know as big bang the big bang is a giant explosion that sent all matter of the universe flying outwards at incredible speeds this explosion and the events that followed would have been too large for us to even imagine over time the debris from the big bang which was almost entirely made of hydrogen and helium began to cool and condense forming the first stars in galaxies including our milky way and eventually our very own solar system earth is one of eight planets that along with several dozens of moons and smaller bodies like poor pluto revolve around the sun due to the orderly nature of our solar system scientists concluded that the earth and all the other planets formed around the same time and they must have come from the same material as the sun the nebular theory proposes that the bodies of our solar system evolved from an enormous rotating cloud called the solar nebula besides the hydrogen and helium from the big bang the solar nebula consisted of microscopic dust grains and matter from dead stars stars actually convert hydrogen and helium into other elements found in the universe this process is called nuclear fusion nearly 5 billion years ago something happened to start causing our solar nebula to begin collapsing in response to its own gravity we think the event could have been a shock wave from an exploding star otherwise known as a supernova that could have facilitated this all to begin as the nebula collapsed it evolved from a huge rotating cloud to a much smaller faster spinning disc gradually through collisions and other interactions the gases and particles began to orbit in one plane this disc continued to spin faster as it shrunk and most of the clouds matter ended up in the center of this disc where it formed the proto-sun which is the beginnings of our very own sun the proto-sun and the inner disc were heated by the gravitational energy of in-falling matter within the inner disc temperatures became high enough for dust grains to evaporate however at distances beyond the orbit of mars temperatures were probably quite low at around negative 200 degrees celsius which is negative 328 degrees fahrenheit the tiny particles in the outer portion of the nebula were probably covered with a thick layer of frozen water carbon dioxide ammonia and methane this disk-shaped cloud also contained good amounts of lighter gases still such as the helium and hydrogen once the sun was formed temperatures in the region where the inner planets reside such as mercury venus earth and mars began to decline this decrease in temperature allowed substances to cool and condense into tiny particles that began to join together materials such as iron and nickel and the various other rock-forming minerals such as silicon calcium sodium and various others this matter formed metallic and rocky clumps that began to orbit the sun over time repeated collisions caused these masses to combine into larger asteroid-sized bodies called planetismuls which after a few more tens of millions of years accreted into what we now know as mercury venus earth and mars at the same time the larger outer planets such as jupiter saturn uranus and neptune along with their extensive satellite or what we know as their moon systems were also developing due to the lower temperatures from being far away from the sun the material here formed a large percentage of ice that contained frozen water carbon dioxide ammonia and methane as well as some rocky and metallic debris as well the accumulation of ice partly accounts for the large size and low density of the outer planets the two most massive planets jupiter and saturn have a surface gravity sufficient enough to attract and hold large quantities of the lightest elements like hydrogen and helium earth began to form about 4.6 billion years ago as material accumulated to form earth high velocity impacts of nebular debris and the radioactive decay of elements caused the temperatures of our planet to soar earth became so hot even hot enough that iron and nickel began to melt this melting produced liquid blobs of dense material to start sinking to the center of our planet this process actually produced earth's iron-rich core this chemical differentiation also led to the formation of all the layers in earth based on density of the materials that make up those layers the core mantle and crust another important consequence of this early period of chemical differentiation is that the large quantities of gaseous materials were allowed to escape earth's interior which is actually still happening today during volcanic eruptions this process from the very primitive atmosphere that gradually evolved to what we now have today and allows life as we know it to exist in the next video we will look into more detail on the internal structure of the earth before we get into more details of that i want to make sure i introduce the geologic time scale the time scale divides the vast 4.6 billion year history of our planet into eons eras periods and epochs numbers on this time scale represent time in millions of years before present the oldest is found at the bottom of this time scale on the left hand side the hadian of the precambrian era as you move up things get younger in the phanerozoic then we can start at the bottom again on the right hand side of the paleozoic the concept of geologic time is new to many non-geologists people are used to dealing with much smaller increments of time measured in hours days months and years history books examine years and even centuries of events but by contrast the geologists must routinely deal with vast time periods in the millions or billions of years when viewed in the context of earth's 4.6 billion year history something that happened 50 million years ago might be categorized as recent to a geologist how long exactly is 4.6 billion years anyway well if you were to begin counting at a rate of one number per second and continued 24 hours a day seven days a week and never stopped it would take about two lifetimes to reach 4.6 billion another wild analogy if we compressed earth's history into a single calendar year anatomically modern humans wouldn't show up until almost midnight on december 31st in the next video we will look at the internal structure of the earth

howdy everyone and welcome to the lecture video on earth's internal structure in module one we talked about the origins of the universe the solar system and the beginning of earth's evolution into what we now know today the chemical differentiation led to the formation of layers in earth based on density of the materials that make up these basic layers the cross mantle and core this is what makes up our geosphere and it is the thickest sphere on earth i like this analogy for earth's interior structure where the skin or fuzz on the peach is the crust and the flesh is the mantle then you can even see the pit of a peach has an outer and inner shell which i never knew before and the shell of the pit can be considered the outer core whereas the seed in the middle can be considered the inner core so earth is a peach here we can categorize earth's internal structure by composition and when we do that we can split earth up into several layers including the crust which is the rocky material it is less dense than the mantle now there are two different types of crust we have oceanic crust which is thinner only about eight kilometers thick and it is mainly composed of basalt which is a rock that we'll talk about when we look at igneous rocks continental crust is another type of crust we have and it is the thicker of the two crusts it is on average about 45 kilometers thick but it can vary between 30 and even up to 70 kilometers thick now the composition of continental crust is granite instead of basalt and these two compositions between the two cross are going to be very important when we talk about plate tectonics so it will come up again now the mantle or that flesh of the ph is the thick shell of dense rocky material the mantle is less dense than the core but it's more dense than the crust now the primary composition of the mantle is something called pyrididite which contains a mineral called olivine and then we have the core the core is the densest layer of the earth it is composed mainly of metallic iron with some nickel and other elements as well now we can split the core up into two layers we have the outer core which is liquid and it has the same composition as the inner core now the inner core the pressures are so high that the iron is solid despite the high temperatures here so we have the solid inner core and the liquid outer core now the outer core is the only layer of earth that is liquid now how do we know that the earth has these layers and that the outer core is liquid well scientists use seismic waves to determine earth's internal structure seismic waves take time to travel through the planet and in general the denser the material the faster the seismic waves will travel seismic waves can also change direction under certain circumstances such as when the physical property of a material in which it's traveling in changes this can cause the waves to be reflected or bounced back or they can be refracted or bent now there are different types of seismic waves but p waves travel faster than other seismic waves and they are the first signal from an earthquake or other seismic source to arrive hence why it is often referred to as the primary wave it is also a compressional wave which is why it is sometimes referred to as a pressure wave as well s waves generally arrive second which is why it is often referred to as the secondary wave it is also known as the shear wave and because we cannot actually shear liquids s waves are unable to propagate through liquids so when humans began recording earthquakes on seismograms throughout the globe we noticed some puzzling observations some stations across the globe did not register any p or s ways after an earthquake and others only recorded p waves and never an s wave this was one of the first evidences that we have that the earth must be composed of different physical layers waves are being reflected and refracted at each layer and no s wave at all travels through the core proving it must have that liquid shell now we can also split up earth's internal structure by physical properties instead of composition and when we do that we can split the earth up into the lithosphere the asthenosphere and the mesosphere now the lithosphere is a rigid layer that includes the crust and the uppermost mantle the rocks here are cooler so they're stronger and more rigid than the plastic asthenosphere below strength is usually a function of temperature and pressure so the lithosphere is thicker under continents than under the oceans and tectonic plates are formed by sections of the lithosphere so when we get into the topic of plate tectonics those tectonic plates are made up of lithosphere so not just the crust but the uppermost mantle as well and that's because we're defining them based on physical properties this is the rigid layer of the earth now below that we have the asthenosphere this is the region of the mantle where rocks become ductile like plastic or silly putty and they have little strength and are easily deformed now the asthenosphere can be from 350 kilometers to 100 to 200 kilometers in depth again the asthenosphere is ductile it is plastic it's movable solid like silly putty unlike the lithosphere which is that rigid layer below so the tectonic plates are formed by the lithosphere which is rigid and we can think of those tectonic plates as floating on that silly putty below of the asthenosphere again we'll talk about this more when we get into plate tectonics but just a brief overview of what to expect now below the east asthenosphere is the mesosphere which is the lower part of the mantle and it's solid with relatively high strength mainly because of the pressure and it can extend from the core into the mantle so 2 83 kilometers in depth to about 350 kilometers in depth so here's just another diagram showing the layers of the earth again you know we have the crust on the top we have two different types of crust oceanic crust which you can see is much thinner than the continental crust which is much thicker and below that we have the mantle now the lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost mantle because it's rigid and the asthenosphere is below and it is more ductile it's a movable solid so that's part of the mantle now we know that the upper mantle is not as dense as the lower mantle because the s and p waves travel more slowly in the upper mantle the upper mantle extends from the base of the crust to a depth of about 415 miles it consists of mostly olivine and silica itself has two distinctly different layers where the lower of this zone is quite plastic this means it is a solid however can readily change shape and flow under stress again like silly putty the lower mantle is more dense and contains mostly iron magnesium and silica and it gets denser as you go down now for the crust again we have two different types of crust we have continental crust which is the thicker of the two it is felsic in composition which is a term which will come up again when we talk about igneous rocks but the predominant rock type the continental crust is granitic granite and you've probably heard of granite or seen granite before it is a lighter colored rock and the important part about this is it has a lower density than the oceanic crust now the oceanic crust is thinner but the most important part about this is that it is denser it is predominantly mafic in composition which means it composes of more dense minerals that contain magnesium and iron the predominant rock type of oceanic crust is basaltic or basalt and again this will come up again when we talk about igneous rocks but basalt is usually darker in colored and again i can't stress this enough the most important part about oceanic crust is the high density so we have continental crust lower density and oceanic crust higher density and these are going to become very important when we talk about plate tectonics because that's going to dictate how they behave at plate boundaries now let's talk about the crust versus lithosphere again remember the crust is only composed of oceanic and continental crust whereas the lithosphere contains both types of crust as well as the uppermost mantle or tectonic plates try not to get them confused so here's just another graphic showing the crustal materials of the earth again the oceanic crust is thinner but it is denser you can see it's about 3.0 grams per cubic centimeter whereas the continental crust even though it's thicker it is less dense 2.7 grams per cubic centimeters and the densities of these two different types of crusts relates to what they're composed of the chemical composition of those crusts so again oceanic crust is denser made of basalt continental crust is less dense made of granite and that brings us to our geologic cycle so earth's interior is involved in our geologic cycle especially our tectonic cycle which we're going to be talking about a lot in the next module and i'm briefly going to introduce the rock cycle in our next lecture ability video in this module but you'll notice the geologic cycle involves lots of cycles in earth systems and even includes the hydraulic cycle which we'll talk about later this semester but in this next video we will briefly introduce the rock cycle

howdy everyone and welcome to the rock cycle lecture video in module one now what exactly is a rock you've probably seen rocks walk on rocks kick rocks but have you really thought about what a rock actually is a rock is a naturally formed consolidated material and it's composed of grains of one or more minerals why are they important well rocks make up the surface of the earth and this is an earth science class after all so we have to start talking about rocks at some point now this rock cycle lecture video is really just a very brief introduction to rocks we're going to be spending a lot of time this semester talking about rocks in more detail later now there are three major rock types there is igneous sedimentary and metamorphic and i will briefly introduce them here today to you but we will talk about each of these three major rock types in much more detail later and that brings us to our rock cycle now the rock cycle pretty much just explains that rock material is constantly recycled into different forms by various processes on or near the earth's surface so you'll notice here i have the rock cycle pictured and i really don't like the word cycle i like more like the rock web because the cycle kind of implies that these things go in one direction but that's not the case at all and this rock cycle it can go in any which direction it wants more like a web if you look at it you see here on the cycle we have the three main rock types igneous rocks metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks and we have some other terms like magma which is just melted material and sediment which is just dirt little bits of rock and this is all involved in that big vast rock cycle and i'll explain a little bit more as we go along but first i want to briefly introduce our igneous rocks and i like to consider these guys the og of rocks the original gangsters these rocks are formed by the colon of magma and magma is the unerupted melted material beneath the earth's surface or they could be cold from lava which is the erupted material above the earth's surface now these types of rocks can form below or near the earth's surface or above and we categorize these two rocks into two different types we call them intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks and it's just describing where they formed but the important part to know at least for module one is that igneous rocks are formed by the cooling of melted material now another type of rocks is something called sedimentary rocks these are formed by the accumulation and cementation of sediments and smaller rocks we can categorize these as well into different categories based on composition of the sediment itself we can categorize them as plastic biological or organic and chemical sedimentary rocks now again we will get into much greater detail later on in the semester and then a third type of rock is something called metamorphic rocks and metamorphic rocks are formed when rocks are subjected to intense heat and or pressure and this actually causes them to alter or change into another rock completely now there are two different types of metamorphism there's contact and there's regional metamorphism which again we'll talk about later in the semester when we get into these metamorphic rocks and we classify them based on how the grains are aligned are they foliated or are they non-foliated and you don't need to know these terms yet but know that you will be introduced to them again later on in the semester all right so that brings us back to our wonderful rock cycle a rock doesn't have to stay the same type forever so remember earth is over 4.6 billion years old not all of the rocks we see are 4.6 billion years old though that's because material is constantly being recycled for example an igneous rock can be weathered eroded and turned into little bits of sediment and that sediment can be carried by a stream and eventually be deposited let's say at a beach and then over time those little sand grains become compacted and cemented together into a completely new rock that we call a sedimentary rock or a metamorphic rock can be buried heated pre-melted then it could be erupted from a volcano and cold to form an igneous rock the rock cycle quite simply implies that earth's materials are constantly recycled and they will continue to recycle now in the final video of this module which we're going to be getting to next we will look at the face of our earth and the different features we find here

all right howdy everyone you've made it to the final lecture video of module one thank you for sticking with me throughout this whole process in this final video we are just going to look at the face of our earth now what do i mean by the face of our earth i'm just going to be talking about the main features that you could see on the earth whether you're looking at it from google earth if you're looking at it from the international space station what are some features that stick out to us when we look at the earth itself well we have features of the ocean floor that include continental margins deep ocean basins and oceanic ridges continental margins are the portion of the sea floor adjacent to major land masses and i'll show a picture of it here shortly the continental shelf is a gently sloping region of continental crust that extends from the shore and then the continental slope is a relatively steep drop-off that extends from the continental shelf to the deep ocean floor and then finally the continental rise consists of a thick wedge of sediment that moved downward from the continental shelf and the slope to accumulate on the sea floor so together the continental shelf slope and rise makes the continental margin although lambda and see meat at the shoreline this is not the actual boundary between continents and ocean basins along most coasts a continental shelf extends seaward because it is underlined with continental crust it is clearly a flooded extension of the continents and as sea level rises and falls throughout time the continental shelf can be extended or shortened now you see that light blue area near the coast of texas in florida that's a continental shelf you can also see it off of the yucatan peninsula off mexico and even all along the eastern coast of the united states i encourage you to go on google earth and see if you can find any other continental shelves now deep ocean basins are the portions of the sea floor between the continental margins and the oceanic ridges the abyssal plain is a flat feature of the deep ocean basin deep ocean trenches are deep and relatively narrow depressions that make up only a small portion of the ocean floor but have a significant amount of geologic activity occurring there and then sea mounts are small volcanic structures that dot the ocean floor oceanic ridges are probably the most prominent feature on the ocean floor and are composed of igneous rock that has been fractured and uplifted now here's an example of the abyssal plain you see the flat region of the pacific ocean basin it pretty much covers almost the entire pacific ocean this is a great example of an abyssal plain and all of our ocean basins contain one now you see that dark blue very deep feature off the east coast of japan this feature extends south to the famous marianas trench that reaches more than 11 000 meters deep that is 36 000 feet this feature actually extends nearly all the way around the pacific ocean and is known as the ring of fire which we'll talk about in the next module but this dark blue very deep feature off the coast of japan is called an ocean trench now do you see that fractured region of the indian ocean here and about the center of this image that's an example of an ocean ridge and this one in particular is called the central indian ridge these ridges can be seen interconnected throughout all of the ocean basins on earth and a more famous one can be seen in the middle of the atlantic ocean i highly recommend you pull up google earth and explore the planet see how many ridges you can find we will actually talk about the origin of these ridges in the next module now we have other features of continents that include mountain belts cratons shields and stable platforms now mountain belts you're probably all familiar with and these are the most prominent features on continents we have these things called cratons which are stable interiors of the continents we have shields which are expansive flat regions of deformed crystalline rocks within the cratons and then we have stable platforms that are flat portions of cratons covered with a thin veneer of sedimentary rock now again we will look at google earth unlike the young mountain belts that have formed within the past 100 million years no i said young 100 million years the interiors of the continents which we call cratons have been relatively stable and undisturbed for the past 600 million years or even longer in some cases typically these regions were involved in mountain building episodes much earlier in earth's history here is an example of one shown as the central dark green region of africa at the equator now this concludes the lecture videos of module one you should now have all of the information you need to complete the participation activity however please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions at all i highly recommend that you read chapter one in your textbook before you take the quiz in the next module we will explore the processes that actually form some of these amazing features we see on earth i'll see you in module 2.
