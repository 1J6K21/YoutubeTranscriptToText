howdy everyone and welcome to module 6 which will be on soil and sedimentary rocks i hope the first exam didn't scare you off too bad in this module we will begin on the material that will be on our next exam exam two in this video we will begin talking about soils and sedimentary rocks with a topic known as mechanical weathering now weathering involves the physical breakdown and chemical alteration of rock at or near the earth's surface and we typically lump these two types of weathering into two categories known as mechanical weathering which is the disintegration of rock and this is the where the physical forces actually break the rocks into smaller pieces now chemical weathering which we'll talk about in the next video is essentially the decomposition of rocks and this is the chemical transformation of the rocks into one or more new compounds both of these types of weathering work simultaneously and reinforce each other now another word you probably heard before and shows up in the textbook a few times is erosion and erosion is the removal and transport of weathered rock by water wind or ice but before we can have erosion we first must have weathered rock by either mechanical weathering or chemical weathering now there are a lot of things that control how a rock is weathered minerals water temperature and climate vegetation all impact weathering rates and the controls on weathering we call them the physical nature controls the chemical nature controls and then the climate now physical characteristics of the rock or sometimes we call the rayology means is the rock brittle or ductile is it hard or soft is it fractured and faulted or is it relatively intact this is what we mean by the physical characteristic of the rock how does the rock react when we put it under stress also to an extent the characteristics of the current landscape plays a role is it on a slope or is it flat are we near a river ocean lake are we in the mountains now the chemical characteristic of the rock or the chemical composition impacts weathering rates as well like is the rock composed of iron is it a soluble material is it a carbonate material really how will it react to the environment at the earth's surface and more importantly how does it react to air or water and of course climate plays a big role because the climate controls the condition on the earth's surface like if we have rain snow ice heat drought cold wind storms you get the point so chemical is a really big player in the controls of weathering on earth now again the physical nature of the rock impacts weathering because it really depends on if the rock is hard or soft is it whole or broken now is the rock hard or soft remember harder materials are more resistant for weathering and erosional processes than softer materials for example in texas you might see ridges and these ridges tend to be made up of harder material or material that is more resistant to weathering and erosion than the surrounding rock and we call that differential weathering now these ridges that we see are usually made up of sandstone whereas the rest of the landscape or the flat areas are usually made up of softer materials like shale now is the rock whole or broken rock that remains largely intact are more resistant to weathering and erosional processes compared to broken rock that has been heavily faltered or fractured this is because fluids and other material like water and ice can fill those cracks causing additional pressure to break up the rock even further or depending on the chemical nature of the rock can dissolve away the material now chemical nature plays a big role and this is where we have the question is if it's iron bearing or not is it soluble or not and is it a carbonate or not now iron bearing versus non-iron bearing plays a role in how the rock reacts with water and oxygen or air as you may know iron has a tendency to rust and rusting is an oxidation reaction which we'll talk more about in the next video when iron reacts with water and oxygen it forms hydrated iron oxide which is what we see as rust iron will rust when it comes into contact with water and oxygen this causes iron-bearing rocks to be easily weathered and eroded due to these chemical reactions now soluble versus insoluble plays a role in how the rock reacts with water as well soluble materials dissolve easily in water such as salt so these materials are easily wetted and eroded as compared to insoluble materials carbonate versus non-carbonate plays a role in how the rock reacts with water as well normal clean rain has a ph value of between 5.0 and 5.5 which is slightly acidic when acids react with carbonates remember which are made up of calcium carbonate like chalk limestone and marble a reaction occurs to form salt water and carbon dioxide again we'll talk about this process more in the next video so you don't really need to know this right now but remember when we talked about how some rocks will react with hydrochloric acid that acid bubbles and fizzes and dissolves the rock away aiding in the weathering process now climate's probably the biggest player and controller of weathering rates on earth and this figure shows that very nicely and i recommend keeping this figure handy as rainfall increases so does weathering especially chemical weathering which again we'll talk about in the next video temperature also plays a role in hotter climates chemical weathering plays a bigger role than physical weathering or mechanical weathering and vice versa and colder climates physical or mechanical weathering plays a bigger role than chemical weathering now rocks can be weathered away by various different processes which we will soon get into but this weathering away of rocks can produce a variety of geometry such as granular disintegration which is a fancy word for turning the rock into loose grains spheroidal weathering which your textbook specifically talks about where a previously angular block of rock can be smoothed over time into a more rounded shape exfoliation which is when the slabs of rocks separate or peel off in layers kind of like when you exfoliate your skin and remove those dead layers of skin same can happen to rocks block separation which is photographed here is when the rock is broken up into smaller blocks over time and then we have shattering which is exactly what it sounds like rock being shattered into a variety of sizes and shapes now for the rest of this video we're going to talk specifically about mechanical weathering mechanical weathering is sometimes referred to as physical weathering and this mechanical weathering occurs by breaking rock into smaller and smaller pieces which increase its surface area for chemical weathering to attack remember these processes are usually occurring side by side and mechanical weathering or physical weathering have five main types and we call them frost wedging salt crystal growth pressure release which your textbook calls sheeting and unloading hydration which your textbook doesn't really talk about but i feel is an important mechanism of physical weathering too and biological activity which we will get into more detail on each of these in a moment let's start with frost wedging frost wedging is the process of breaking down rock as the water within its fractures and pores freezes and thaws in response to the warming and cooling of rocks this is because when water freezes and turns into ice it also expands therefore during this process of ice formation it will begin pushing on the rock around it to allow it more space this is very similar to how potholes form during the winter and spring potholes of course are probably not that common here in texas as they are where i'm from in pittsburgh pennsylvania potholes are more common where nightly average low temperatures get down to 15 degrees fahrenheit on a consistent basis and an average high temperature reaches above freezing point around 40 degrees fahrenheit which is exactly what happens in vast portions of our country during winter and early spring therefore frost wedging is most common in higher latitude regions of our globe at higher elevations and in tundra environments the primary geometries we often see associated with this is shattering and block separation here's a photo showing block separation due to frost wedging and here's a photo that shows what shattering looks like now here's a figure showing frost wedging in action where we have higher elevations involved here you can see the water that gets between the rocks here is pushing out in all directions as it freezes forcing the rock to crack and break even further which we call that block separation this produces hazards for anyone below because this process can actually result in rock avalanches and rock slides salt crystal growth happens in areas that experience sea spray or rocks that come into contact with salty groundwater where salt begins filling the pores and cracks within the rock and over time that water will evaporate leaving the salt behind these salt crystals will begin to grow and take up more and more space over time this is similar to frost wedging where the salt instead of the ice begins pushing outwards on the rock forcing it to break apart and some common examples of minerals associated with this is our lovely table salt halite and gypsum now salt crystal growth primarily occurs in arid environments but can occur along rocky coasts as well and even on human structures like bricks and roads which can aid in the formation of potholes in areas that use salt to melt snow and ice the primary geometry associated with salt crystal growth is granular disintegration release or your textbook refers to it as sheeting and unloading occurs when deeply buried rocks become exposed at the surface due to erosion since the rock is no longer underneath the immense pressure it once was deep underground the rock is then able to relax and expand releasing stress and this causes slabs to separate or peel off in the process creating an exfoliation dome this type of weathering has very little climatic influence here i'm showing the primary geometries associated with cheating and unloading like exfoliation which we talked about there on the left but we can also see block separation as well as shown on the right here is a figure showing the unloading of the rock above an igneous body that is able to expand and break apart as sheets or exfoliate hydration occurs due to the wetting and drying of rocks over time without the presence of salt in this process no chemical change is taking place just a physical change of the presence of water being evaporated over time there are additional weathering that is probably occurring due to the water that is chemical which we'll talk about in the next video but here i'm just referring to the physical breaking away of rock due to the wetting and drying forming things that you all have probably seen before like mud cracks this can cause shattering the rock and even block separation sometimes and finally we have biological activity which can break down rocks by the activities of organisms including plants burn animals and even humans plant roots very commonly break apart rock as they grow in search of nutrients and water and wedge themselves in between the rocks in the way burrowing animals break down rock by bringing fresh material to the surface where additional mechanical and chemical weathering can take place and then of course us humans crush rock on a regular basis for mining purposes and construction of structures decaying organisms can also produce acids but that contributes to chemical weathering which we'll talk about in the next video here's a photo showing biological activity such as root wedging that's mechanically weathering the rock over time in the next video we will explore how rocks can be weathered over time by chemical processes

howdy everyone and welcome to the second video of module 6 on chemical weathering chemical weathering involves complex processes that break down rocks and the internal structure of minerals it involves chemical reactions the most important agent or catalyst of these reactions is just water pure water alone is a good solvent but by increasing its acidity you can increase its power there are three main processes of chemical weathering that we will talk about called dissolution oxidation and hydrolysis dissolution is the process of dissolving material into a homogeneous solution simple solution is one process in which we could do this and is common with rocks containing the mineral halite salt dissolves in water easy enough to understand a small amount of acid and water increases the corrosive force of water causing additional dissolution one example of this happening is through a process called carbonation carbonic acid is created when carbon dioxide dissolves in raindrops within the atmosphere this easily attacks rocks containing carbonate minerals such as calcite limestones are one type of rock that contains abundant calcite and the process of carbonation is what is actually responsible for forming caves here's a figure showing the dissolution of halite in water through a process known as simple solution weathering here we have the halite minerals dissolving in water this process is reversible though through evaporation the physical forms of this type of weathering is granular disintegration carbonation is the primary chemical weathering mechanism for carbonate rock and minerals carbonation is the process of rock minerals reacting with carbonic acid again carbonic acid is formed when water combines with carbon dioxide carbonic acid dissolves or breaks down minerals in the rock here i have shown the chemical reactions you can see we form carbonic acid when we combine carbon dioxide co2 with water h2o now calcite which is caco3 can be broken down when combined with carbonic acid which is what we formed when we combined carbon dioxide and water and this forms byproducts such as calcium and bicarbonate again this carbonation is the process responsible for forming the beautiful caves we see here on earth oxidation is the primary chemical weathering mechanism involving iron-bearing silicate minerals oxidation is the reaction of rock minerals with oxygen thus changing the mineral composition of the rock when minerals and rock oxidize they become less resistant to weathering iron a commonly known mineral becomes red or rust colored when oxidized this process is slow in dry environments because water increases the speed of this reaction it is an important process in decomposing ferromagnesium minerals or are dark silicates like olivine pyroxene hornblende and biotite oxidation is only able to occur after the iron has been freed from the silicate structure and this occurs in a process called hydrolysis which we will talk about shortly here's a photo showing how many sedimentary rocks are very colorful the most important pigments are just small amounts of iron oxide just like the iron oxide colors of the rusty barrels this is what causes those beautiful reds and oranges we see in the grand canyon hydrolysis is the primary chemical weathering mechanism for silicate rocks and minerals water can actually change the chemical composition and size of minerals in a rock making them less resistant to weathering hydrolysis is when the molecules in water separate to release hydrogen ions and hydroxide and those ions then react with minerals replacing other elements like potassium calcium and sodium this kind of weathering often produces clay minerals quartz and even soluble salts a hydrolysis reaction of orthoclase which is an alkali feldspar shown here highlighted in red is a common mineral found in igneous rocks and when combined with water yields kalanite which is a clay mineral silica silicic acid and potassium now remember the rates of weathering are influenced heavily on the physical and chemical nature of the rocks and climate the mineral composition and the solubility of a rock contributes significantly to how easily it can be weathered silicate minerals weather in the same order as crystallization seen in bowen's reaction series climate is a major contributor because temperature and precipitation is crucial and it controls the frequency of freeze thaw provides the moisture available for dissolution and creates the conditions favorable for vegetation growth you can see the two different tombstones made of relatively around the same time the tombstone on the left is composed of granite and the granite headstone still looks fresh whereas the tombstone on the right made of marble which is a calcium-rich rock has dissolved away over time making the inscription barely legible here is a photo showing how acid rain can accelerate chemical weathering you can see this statue has significantly degraded over time due to the elements it is exposed to here's that diagram we talked about in the last video that shows how climate influences weathering on the y-axis we have average yearly temperature increasing from top to bottom so the colder temperatures are on the top on the x-axis we have average yearly rainfall decreasing from left to right so the wetter climates are on the left here in this figure you can see that the lower temperatures and drier conditions leads to a slowing down of chemical weathering where physical or mechanical weathering is the most dominant and where we have higher temperatures and wetter conditions chemical weathering has a very strong role hopefully you now understand that not all rock masses weather away equally this is called differential weathering and creates the remarkable landscapes of the bisti badlands in new mexico which is shown here remember ship rock that we talked about in the last module shiprock is a volcanic neck made of intrusive igneous rock that is now exposed at the surface because the original volcano made of layers of hardened lava and ash which are extrusive are weathered away more easily the interest of rock in the volcanic neck is harder and more resistant allowing it to stick around long after the remaining volcano has weathered away now that we understand how rock can be weathered away over time in the next video we will explore how soil is formed

howdy everyone and welcome to the video on soil formation soil is often referred to as the bridge between life and the inanimate world it is an interface between all of earth spheres because it contains water and sometimes ice air rock and organic matter weathering is important to the formation of soil which is why we talked about that first the earth's land surface is covered by layers of rocks and mineral fragments produced by weathering and this layer is called a regolith soil is the portion of the regolith that supports the growth of plants hummus is a term we use to describe organic matter and soil and hummus is produced from the decomposition of plants and animals about one half of the total volume of good quality surface soil is a mixture of disintegrated rock and mineral matter with hummus most soils contain particles of variety of sizes soil texture refers to the proportions of these different particle sizes and is heavily influenced on the soil's ability to transmit and retain water and air we recognized four basic soil structures as platy prismatic blocky and spheroidal which influences how easily the soil can be cultivated how susceptible it is to erosion and which describes the amount of empty space and permeability which describes how easily a fluid can be transmitted through it soil scientists use this diagram to classify soil textures this diagram is a triangle with each point representing a specific particle size like the smallest being clay at the top clay is less than .002 millimeters in diameter on the right side of this diagram we have it being represented by silt which is between .002 and 0.06 in diameter and you don't need to memorize this right now and on the left of the diagram we have sand which is between 0.6 and 2.0 millimeters in diameter now clay soils have a high percentage of clay minerals no surprise there sandy clays have some sand and some clay silty clays have some silt and some clay whereas sand soil is almost completely made of sand and silk soil is almost completely made of silt not too complicated now there are many controls on the formation of soil such as the parent material climate plants and animals thyme topography and we will get into each of these in more detail in a moment apparent material is the source of weathered material that forms soils and this can come in the form of residual soils which are the soils formed from the bedrock or transported soils which are soils developed from unconsolidated sediment elsewhere this parent material really impacts the rate of soil formation and its organic matter content here you can see a nice diagram of locations and what you can expect their parent material to be composed of along steep slopes we generally have no soil development quite simply because of gravity in low-lying areas this is where we could expect to have transported soil from the unconsolidated stream deposits that are carried from elsewhere and on flat terrains this is where we can expect residual soil that is developed on the bedrock found here the composition of the bedrock is what will determine the soil chemical composition and the thickness of the soil climate is considered to be the most influential control of soil formation due to the crucial factors involving temperature and precipitation which we saw in the last two videos this is going to overall determine the degree and the rate of weathering of rocks that will contribute to the soil composition the types and abundance of organisms within a soil will strongly influence their physical and chemical properties the primary source of organic matter in soils is plants microorganisms play a role in the decaying of plant and animal remains resulting in hummus earthworms and other burrowing animals mix this organic portion of the soil in a process we call bioturbation now the nature of vegetation in an area can have a significant influence on soil formation example in the northern coniferous forests the organic litter is high in acid resin which contributes to the accumulation of acid in the soil here as a result acid leaching is an important soil forming process in deserts the very little rainfall reduces the rates of weathering and vegetation growths this results in desert soils being very thin and lacking organic content soils that develop in well-drained prairies typically have a hummus rich surface horizon that is rich in calcium and magnesium making it extremely fertile this makes for great farmland and is also why a lot of our farms are built on pre-existing prairie lands now time is a big control on soil formation because like as you can imagine the more time you have the thicker your soil becomes short periods of time produce thin soils that resemble the parent material where longer periods of time generate thicker soils that can be very different from the apparent material once came from variations in topography can lead to a variety of soils topography mostly impacts moisture content and how much exposure to sunlight a soil will receive steep slopes often have poorly developed soils because the moisture content of these areas is often insufficient for plant growth due to the rapid runoff flat surfaces are the most optimal because they generally have good drainage and minimal erosion slope orientation is what impacts the exposure to sunlight southern facing slopes in the northern hemisphere will receive the most sunlight and are optimal for soil formation these soil forming processes operate from the surface downwards creating horizontal layers that we call horizons a vertical section through all of the soil horizons is called a soil profile a mature soil will have well-developed horizons whereas an immature soil might lack horizons altogether here is a soil profile of a mature soil showing the variety of different horizons we can expect to find such as o and a horizons at the top which we conveniently call topsoil followed by e horizon b horizon and lastly c horizon which usually sits on top of unearthed parent material o soil horizon is the top most horizon in a soil profile and contains organic matter the upper portion of this soil horizon is primarily plant matter and water is able to percolate downwards carrying dissolved inorganic soil into the deeper zones the lower portion of the o soil horizon is made of partly decomposed organic matter both portions of the o soil are teeming with bacteria fungi algae and insects deserts often have the thinnest o layer because of the lack of rainfall and vegetation the a soil horizon right below is made of organic and mineral matter and also has high biologic activity together the o and a horizons make up the top soil and they are important because they are a mixture of sediment the e horizon has little organic matter so it is often lighter in color dark soils generally indicate high organic matter alluviation which is the washing out of fine soil components to lower soil layers is common here soluble inorganic components are often washed to lower layers in a process called leaching b horizons which we sometimes just call the subsoil is the zone of accumulation where the material wash from the e horizon accumulates the c horizon is partially altered parent material and is sitting directly on top of unaltered parent material soils are vital for the growth of rooted plants such as crops that we rely on for our basic survival just like how we humans can increase productivity of soils by introducing fertilizer and irrigation we can just as easily damage and destroy it soils are one of the most abused natural resources on our planet let's take a look at a case study in the clearing away of a tropical rainforest rainforests are often cleared for logging and agricultural uses the very thick soils here are surprisingly poor nutrients and unsuitable for farmland because most of the nutrients are actually locked up in the vegetation making the soils not very fertile once we remove the trees and the vegetation we see a dramatic increase in soil erosion and an increase in exposure to sunlight which dries up the soil and turns them into nearly solid bricks so why should we care about soil erosion since soil erosion is a natural process in the rock cycle after all while soil formation is a very slow process and if we erode more soil than is being produced we will quickly lose our vital resource erosion rates are dependent on climate slope and type of vegetation deforestation and farming practices often enhance soil erosion water flowing on deforested ground will start to call a process called sheet erosion which is when water flows along tiny channels called rills that eventually grow into bigger channels called gullies this process cannot be remediated by normal cultivation here are some photos showing the sheet erosion in action you can see the tiny channels called rails being formed on the left and eventually they will form bigger channels called gullies like the farm on the right these channels are not just carrying rainwater but also layers of soil with it after each rainfall the dust bowl was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the economy and agriculture of the american and canadian prairies during the 1930s with texas oklahoma and kansas being the hardest hit areas the severe drought on the failure to apply dry land farming methods which left the dry soil unprotected and caused them to be especially vulnerable to wind many families were forced to leave their farms and travel to other areas seeking work this abandonment of farms caused financial ruin from the catastrophic top soil loss and led to widespread hunger and poverty the dust storms that were created were known as black blizzards and in one storm caused the destruction of more than 350 homes half a million americans were left homeless some residents became sick and died of dust pneumonia or malnutrition numerous livestock also died and crops began to fail across the entire region this is just one example of the severe consequences of soil erosion when we think of civilization ending we usually think about disease or nuclear war or meteor impact but in reality soil loss is just as real as a threat we lose more than one percent of productive agricultural soil every year on average in a lot of areas in the world especially where we see greatest population growths like sub-sahara africa we are losing more soil than is being replenished unnecessary soil loss is occurring on nearly every continent there are some things we can do to try to prevent soil loss and erosion like constructing terraces where steep slopes are being farmed to help slow runoff or planting strips of grass and cover crops parallel to slopes to slow runoff and trap sediment and even creating grass drain ways to prevent the formation of gullies and trapped soil are all ways that we can try to prevent or decrease the amount of soil loss here are some examples of soil conservation taking place on a farm in iowa you can see here that they planted grass along drainage pathways and along contours of the hillside in between crops here's another grass waterway and a farm in pennsylvania wind is also a major player in erosion not just water here is an example of soil conservation to reduce wind erosion in this north dakota farm they planted rows of trees to try to deflect the wind this concludes our videos on the formation of soils in the remaining videos of this module we are going to focus on sedimentary rocks and their structures

howdy everyone and welcome to the second part of module 6. most of our continent is actually covered with a layer of sedimentary rocks so it's very important that we spend some time discussing what these are how they formed and why we should care remember our rock cycle remember the rock cycle describes how rock material is constantly recycled into different forms by various processes on or near the earth's surface in the last couple of videos we actually talked a lot about some of the processes in this rock site like weathering while weathered rock can be eroded or transported and eventually deposited in layers of sediment and sometimes creating soils in this video we are going to talk about another process in the rock cycle that leads to the formation of sedimentary rocks called compaction and cementation sedimentary rocks are formed by the accumulation and cementation of sediments in smaller rocks they are categorized by the source and composition of the sediments and they exist in three main categories that we call clastic biological or organic and chemical sedimentary rocks before we start diving into sedimentary rocks i want to introduce you to some terms that we may talk about and you might read about in your textbook some of these terms we have already used in previous modules and videos but there may be some new ones that will come up i can almost guarantee you that all of these terms will come up again in future videos and modules let's start with sediment what is sediment sediment is the loose particles of minerals or rock and they come from the weathering and erosion or the precipitation from solution which is usually by evaporation or the secretion by organisms which we'll get into later weathering remember is the process that changes rocks at the earth's surface and it can be chemical physical or biological and we lump them into two categories called chemical and mechanical erosion is the physical removal or the transport of that sediment on earth's surface and that can be done by water wind ice or even gravity deposition is when transported sediment settles or comes to rest it is no longer moving lithification is the consolidation of cements or sediments into sedimentary rock elitification includes compaction cementation and sometimes recrystallization remember crystallization is the growth and development of mineral crystals and in sedimentary rocks salt crystals can develop in evaporates and crystallization can occur in some limestones now what is the cement well cement is the solid material that precipitates in the pore space which literally cements the sediment together here's a slide showing that part of the rock cycle of compaction and cementation in a we have sediment or mineral particles like quartz and feldspars being deposited loosely in between these grains of quartz and feldspar we have empty space that we call pore space and that pore space can be filled with just air or sometimes the pore space can be filled with fluids like water or oil sometimes we even have natural gas and methane that occupies these pore spaces so you can see why sedimentary rocks are quite important to us over time shown in b we begin to have more and more material being deposited on top which increases the weight or pressure from above called overburden and this overburden causes the sediment to consolidate or compact you can see here that the pore space starts to decrease as this process of compaction takes place then in c we start to have all that pore space filled with cement which we call cementation forming our sedimentary rock many sedimentary rocks are deposited horizontally in layers that we call beds which we will talk about later on in this module these rocks can also contain other structures that we will later talk about like ripple marks and mud cracks that give us clues to the ancient environments on earth another mostly unique characteristic of sedimentary rocks is that they are often the only type of rock that contains fossils fossils are any evidence of pre-existing life forms they don't have to be a whole or partial skeleton of an organism they can also be footprints tracks trails and even fecal matter fossils provide information about ancient ecosystems the history of life and even help with the relative age of deposits here's a photo showing the bedding that can develop in sedimentary rocks here is an example of something called cross bedding that is the result of dunes created by wind or water currents we will see more of these later here's a brief glimpse on how cross-bedding forms again we will revisit this in more detail towards the end of this module plastic rocks or sometimes they are called solicit plastic since the majority of the minerals that make up these rocks are silicates are the result of the weathering of rocks on the earth's surface that produce sediment and over time these sediments are compressed and cemented together producing a classic sedimentary rock called plastic see what i did there in our next video we will spend time looking at clastic rocks but we will generally classify them based on their grain sizes which again we'll talk about in that video here are examples of some clastic sedimentary rocks with conglomerate containing our largest grains sandstone containing sand-sized grains and shales containing our smallest grains of clay again we will spend much more time on this in the next video organic rocks sometimes called biological rocks are sedimentary rocks where the sediments cemented together actually contain biological material such as shells shown in the upper left photograph of coquina limestone and plants shown in the upper right photograph of coal we will also spend an entire video looking at this type in more detail chemical rocks are sedimentary rocks that have been formed by inorganic chemical reactions like seawater being evaporated leaving behind salt to form a rock known quite simply as roxul we also have an entire video on this type so hang tight for more information on these so why in the world should we study sedimentary rocks while sedimentary rocks contain fossil fuels like hydrocarbons and coal which our society still relies on to function there are a whole host of other economical minerals contained in these rocks like uranium iron ore and sulfur we use sand for glass and as an aggregate we use gravel and construction we use limestones and sandstones as building stone we use gypsum and other salts and fertilizers and fertilizers actually get their phosphates and nitrates from sediments and sedimentary rocks sedimentary rocks also provide us so much useful information on the geologic history of an area with the fossils and sedimentary structures with those we are able to infer ancient ecosystems the history of life relative age dates and past environments probably the biggest reason to study sediments and sedimentary rocks though is that they contain groundwater in the next video we are going to dive into the details on clastic sedimentary rocks i'll see you there

howdy everyone now we're going to begin exploring the details of each three types of sedimentary rocks beginning with clastic sedimentary rocks plastic sedimentary rocks form from cements sediments that have been weathered and transported they are mostly made up of clay minerals quartz feldspars and micas and we use particle size to distinguish among the various rock types it also presents important information about the environment of deposition which we will soon talk about some common classic sedimentary rocks include shale sandstone conglomerate and brecho and if you take this lab portion of the class you will see all of these in your lab plastic rocks are classified based on the size and sometimes shape of the grains that make them gravel-sized grains are our largest and shown here at the top and they are any grain larger than two millimeters in diameter they include granules pebbles cobbles and even boulders plastic sedimentary rocks that contain gravel-sized grains are called conglomerates or brechus the difference between the two as you can see in these photos is that the grains and conglomerate are rounded and the grains in breccia are much more angular plastic rocks that contain sand-sized grains are generally called sandstones sand is a particle between the sizes of 1 16 of a millimeter to 2 millimeters in diameter there are other variations with stand stones like arcos which is shown here and archos are generally made up of feldspar grains and they usually are more angular and poorly sorted like shown here plastic rocks with mud sized grains contain particles of silt and clay silts are slightly smaller than sand but bigger than clay they are between 1 256 of a millimeter to 1 16 of a millimeter plastic rocks that contain silts are quite simply called silt stone rocks that contain clay which are extremely small particles that are less than 1 256 of a millimeter are called shales or mudstones the easiest way to determine grain size without actually measuring them is by look and feel gravel size pieces are very easy to see with the naked eye and quite literally look like gravel sand gets a little bit more difficult to see with the naked eye but everyone has probably seen sand at some point in their life at a beach or in a sandbox's children sand grains are made up of that sand and feel like sandpaper to the touch silt almost feels sandy but you can't see individual grains very easily in siltstone these rocks will sometimes look smooth but still feel gritty and individual clay grains cannot be seen with naked eye you would need a microscope to see these so shales tend to have a smooth texture now let's look at this in more detail sales again consist of our smallest grained particles that we call clay these form from gradual settling of sediments in quiet non-turbulent environments like lakes floodplains and deep ocean basins sediments and shale form in very thin layers that are sometimes called laminae xiao has something called facility which means the rock could be split into thin layers fail tends to crumble easily and tends to form more gentler slopes and shale is actually the most common and abundant sedimentary rock on planet earth here's a photo showing an example of shale here you can see that the shale is formed in very thin layers and you can almost see that laminae you can almost tell that this rock can break very easily along those layers and has facility shales can be seen all across the road on road cuts as you travel on many of the interstates throughout our country now how can you tell the difference between mudstones or shales versus silk stones remember they're both made up of very small grains well mud stones will break into chunks or blocks while siltstone lacks that facility and is often grouped with shale though now siltstone is composed of mostly silt-sized particles however it can contain some clay-sized particles so it becomes very difficult to identify between the two here's an example of silt stones and mudstones again just like shales they tend to form more gentler slopes because they're more easily erodible here's some examples of shale with sandstone and limestone and this gets into something that we call differential weathering that we talked about a few videos ago now shale is considered weak and it is more easily erodible while the sandstone and limestone above it is much more resistant to weathering and it sticks out of the landscape in a much steeper terrain this is exactly what produces a lot of the landscapes we see out west where the weak shale produces the gradual gentle slopes and the sandstones and limestones produce those prominent clays now sandstone's made up of sand-sized particles that's pretty easy to remember it forms in a variety of environments though sandstone is the second most abundant sedimentary rock behind shale quartz is the most abundant mineral found in sandstone and quartz sandstone is predominantly made up of quartz that's easy to remember our coast sandstone contains appreciable amounts of feldspar and then sometimes we categorize sandstone as a gray wacky and gray wackies contain rock fragments and a matrix in addition to quartz and sandstone here's a photograph showing quartz sandstone you can see its sandy texture but if you look up close you see that these grains are rounded and well sorted which we'll talk about here in a moment now for sandstones particles are classified by sorting which is the degree of similarity in particle size and shape if all the grains in the rock are a similar size we consider that rock to be well sorted if the grains contain lots of different sizes in that rock both large and small the rock is considered poorly sorted sorting can actually help decipher the depositional environment of the rock particle shape can vary from rounded to angular and the degree of rounding is an indicator on how far the sediments have been transported rounded sediments are typically transported to great distances whereas angular sediments are only transported a short distance and are closer to the source now here's a nice figure showing that sorting and particle shape now this doesn't just apply for sandstones but really it applies for all rock types you can see very very poorly sediment a very poorly sorted sediment have particles of very different sizes we have large particles and small particles within that matrix whereas the very well sorted sediment you can see all of the sediment there are relatively the same size then the green shape is pretty self-explanatory we have our angular which have a lot of sharp corners and are rounded which are rounded now again this doesn't just apply for sandstones it applies for all rock types and the farther the sediments have been transported the more sorted they will become and the rounder they get that's the important part to remember the farther the sediments have been transported the more well sorted they become and the more rounder they get so here's just a photo showing how sand dunes consist of well-sorted sediment here in a you see the orange and yellow cliffs of utah zion national park this exposes thousands of feet of jurassic age navajo sandstone where b this shows the quartz grain composing the navajo sandstones were deposited by wind as dunes very similar to colorado's great sand dunes shown here the sand is well sorted because all the particles are relatively the same size so the solid cliffs at utah zion national park were formed in a similar environment that we now see at colorado's great sand dunes national park here's a photo showing sandstones again sandstones create steeper terrain because it is more resistant to weathering and oftentimes form very prominent cliffs conglomerate and ruptures consist of rounded or angular gravel-sized sediments bratshells are the ones that consist of the angular gravel-sized sediments whereas conglomerate consists of the rounded gravel-sized sediments both types of rocks though are usually poorly sorted and they they don't travel very far from their source here we can talk about sorting again this is an example of poorly sorted sediments and it is easy to see that here because we are looking at gravel-sized grains instead of sand these sediments probably didn't travel very far from their source unless of course they're the result of a glacial deposit glacial deposits tend to look similar to this and are very poorly sorted as well here's a photograph showing a conglomerate it is also resistant to weathering and oftentimes sticks out of the landscape similar to sand stems here is a nice figure that shows how all of these properties we talked about like sediment size shape and sorting can all tell us a lot about the environment in which it's formed and how far away from its source material it traveled now here in the figure at 1 you can see this hasn't traveled very far from the source and when i talk about source i'm indicating the pre-existing rock that was there before it was weathered and eroded and turned into sedimentary rock so the source tends to be where we have higher elevation higher terrain like mountains and over time our mountains are going to be weathered and eroded away turn into sediment and eventually turn to sedimentary rock so when i talk about our source i'm usually talking about mountainous terrain so there in one you can see we haven't traveled very far from our source and if you zoom in closely to the particles that contain a lot of the sedimentary rocks found here the particles are large in size and are irregular they usually consist of a variety of minerals including some that are weathered pretty easily now at number two you can see we've traveled a little bit further and the particles now become mid-sized and more rounded and they include fewer minerals that weather easily now traveling even further to three these particles are now small and rounded and well sorted and they consist mainly of minerals that resist weathering such as quartz grain size decreases grain roundness increases and sorting increases with distance important to remember that grain size decreases grain roundness increases and sorting increases with distance now let's take a look at some real examples of these here closest to the source is a rock that we find called breccia it has the largest grain size of gravel it's angular and poorly sorted if this breccia or the sediments that contain breccia were allowed to travel a little bit further those grains would have eventually been smoothed over and become more rounded and more sorted like we see in this conglomerate here now if grains are able to travel even further downstream they are going to begin to become more rounded because they're being smoothed over as they travel at the bottom of usually a stream bed bouncing into other sediments bouncing into the bottom of the stream bed and that's going to smooth them over and continue to decrease their size they're going to get smaller they're going to get more rounded and eventually those grains can form a sandstone now when we get far far away we start to get finer and finer sediments like way out in the deep ocean that's when we have clay grain settling on the ocean floor forming shale so fine grain well-rounded well-sorted sediments travel the farthest that's super cool stuff in the next video we will look at organic sedimentary rocks

howdy everyone and welcome to the video on organic sedimentary rocks organic sedimentary rocks are sometimes known as biological sedimentary rocks are rocks that contain sediments and also contain biological material like organic carbon some examples of organic sedimentary rocks include coal which most of you have probably heard about and oil shale which we'll talk about in this video now coal is made from organic matter making it an organic sedimentary rock organic sedimentary rocks form from carbon-rich remains of organisms which usually are plants especially in the case of coal now occasionally plant structures like their leaves bark and even wood are sometimes still identifiable in coal swamps are ideal environments for the formation of coal because swamps are stagnant which creates an environment depleted of oxygen this oxygen pore environment allows for the growth of bacteria to attack the organic material and liberate the oxygen and hydrogen from the dead plants as these elements escape it leaves behind carbon-rich deposits and since the bacteria are unable to finish the job thanks to the acids produced from liberating the dead plants this carbon material over time is compacted and lithified to form coal here's a figure showing the stages of coal formation at stage one dead plants are accumulating in the oxygen-poor environment like a swamp this allows that certain bacteria to partially decompose the plants to free their oxygen and hydrogen which escape and allows the carbon content to slowly increase in stage 2 these partially decomposed plants begin to compact and as more and more layers are deposited on top this increases the pressure this eventually will create a soft brown material called peat and that will eventually turn into lignite which is a soft brown coal as more and more layers are deposited on top it increases the pressure and it also increases the temperature that the coal is under in stage three the temperatures become high enough to bring about chemical reactions which release volatiles like water and other organic gases and increases the fixed carbon making it a much better source of energy and it becomes harder and turns into a black rock known as bituminous coal then in stage four as the pressure and temperature temperature continues to rise our biological sedimentary rock begins to metamorphose and turns into a metamorphic rock known as anthracite coal anthracite tends to be very hard and shiny we will talk more about metamorphic rocks in the next module the important part to note here though is that the grade of coal increases with compaction or pressure and temperature oil shale is another organic sedimentary rock that contains kerogen which is a solid organic compound derived from the remains of algae that were deposited along with the clay minerals perogene is not a mature hydrocarbon so it's not a useful source of energy it would require substantial amounts of processing shale oil is a rock that contains more mature oil and gas and we'll talk about here in a moment so your textbook talks about oil shale versus shale oil remember oil shale is a biological sedimentary rock where shale oil is a clastic sedimentary rock that contains oil again oil shale is a biological sedimentary rock shale oil is a clastic sedimentary rock that we call shale and it just contains oil shale oil is a more mature oil and gas unlike the carriage and found in oil shales but shale oil is coming from the clastic version of shale where the oil and gas migrated there after its formation and it now exists in the tiny pore spaces of the shale the oil and gas found in these shales cannot be extracted using traditional methods and instead they require horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing also known as fracking to extract it in the next video we will talk about chemical sedimentary rocks and how some rocks can actually be considered biochemical

howdy everyone and welcome to the video on our last type of sedimentary rocks called chemical sedimentary rocks chemical sedimentary rocks form from the precipitated material that was once in a solution this precipitation can occur by inorganic processes like evaporation or chemical activity or it can be formed by organic processes from usually water dwelling organisms and form rocks we consider biochemical some examples of chemical sedimentary rocks include limestone chirp and rock salt which we will talk about here in a moment limestone is the most abundant chemical sedimentary rock and is mainly composed of the mineral calcite which remember is a carbonate mineral that reacts with acid now limestone is a tricky one to classify because it can be formed by two different processes limestone can form from inorganic processes and it can form by biochemical origins now the biochemical version of limestone is usually easier to understand this originates from the shells of marine organisms which are made of calcite large quantities of marine limestone are usually formed from corals and corals actually secrete calcium carbonate or also known as that calcite to create their skeleton and they create the reefs such as australia's great barrier reef which is the largest on earth i don't know if anyone has been to guadalupe national park in west texas but the highest point in texas is located here at el capitan now the el capitan i'm talking about is not the more famous one found in california this is the one found in the guadalupe mountains of texas this el capitan sticks out of the landscape like this because it is composed of an ancient coral reef complex that was once very similar to what the great great barrier reef looks like today picture on the far right is me 12 years ago standing in front of that peak if you ever get a chance i highly recommend you check out this beautiful park in west texas hokina is also a version of limestone and is nearly composed of 100 fragments of shell material that are loosely cemented together and in my opinion resembles a granola bar chalk is also a form of limestone however this limestone is formed from much finer grained material known as a marine ooze this marine ooze contains millions of tiny microscopic organisms called forminifera and cocolithophores that also make their skeletons out of calcium carbonate these deposits can become very thick like we see in the famous white cliffs of dover these cliffs are filled with hundreds of millions of microscopic dead ocean creatures so the next time you write with chalk you will now know that you are just smearing dead stuff on a chalkboard geology is neat huh now limestone is a common sedimentary rock again that's composed of mostly of the mineral calcite remember limestone is produced by two different processes it can be produced by crystallization from water or by the accumulation of shells and shell fragments now remember limestone is biochemical or chemical sedimentary rocks and here's a photograph showing what limestone looks like in a formation now here's showing this white cliffs of dover and a little bit better of a photograph this is chalk remember chalk is also a biochemical sedimentary rock and they can form in very thick deposits such as this now the inorganic limestone tends to be a little harder to understand but this formed when chemical changes increase the calcium carbonate content of the water until it precipitates out of a solution this commonly forms travertines which is the kind of limestone found in caves where the calcium carbonate precipitated from the groundwater this is the same process that forms that hard crud you get on your kitchen and bathroom faucets over time that crusty stuff that forms is calcium carbonate precipitating out of the water over time yes you are likely forming rocks in your kitchens and bathrooms as we speak right now pretty cool oolytic limestone is composed of small spherical grains of calcium carbonate that we call oids they resemble tiny seeds that were rolled in shallow marine water that had very high concentrations of calcium carbonate the only place on earth that i know about forming these things today is in the bahamas here's a photo showing an oolytic limestone if you were to zoom in on its texture you would see those tiny spherical grains called buoys tholestone is remarkably similar to limestone but instead of calcium carbonate it's made of magnesium carbonate it also will react to acid but only once it's been crushed scientists still don't agree on the origin of dollastone because we don't know of any organisms that make skeletons from magnesium carbonate however it is believed to be formed from inorganic processes when magnesium-rich water is circulated through limestone tert is composed of microcrystalline quartz and is formed when silica precipitates out of water some variations of chert include flint which i happen to know is the state of ohio state rock random fact jasper and agate here's a figure showing the beautiful variations of chert evaporates are probably the easiest form of chemical rocks to understand their formation evaporates form when restricted seaways become oversaturated and the salt starts depositing this commonly happens where water is constantly being lost due to evaporation because only water is evaporated the salts get left behind and will over time accumulate more and more this forms rock salt and rock gypsum occasionally we have evaporates that form on salt flats when that dissolved material is precipitated as a white crust on the ground here's an example of a salt flat found in utah called the bonneville salt flats the great salt lake is actually the remnants of a much larger body of water called lake bonneville and the salt flats are deposits of up to two meters thick of salt that was left behind once lake bonneville began evaporating evaporating white sands national park is the result of evaporites like gypsum forming after a shallow sea that once covered this area in the permian evaporated leaving behind the calcium sulfate or gypsum now let's practice sedimentary rocks now that we've discussed all three different types let's start with the rock on the left now that we know a little bit about the three types of rocks which type of sedimentary rock would you think is the rock on the left would you think it's a clastic rock made up of bits of sediment or rock fragments would you think it's a biological rock made up of organic carbon or would you say this is probably a chemical rock made out of a chemical reaction like an evaporate you'd probably guess clastic right because this rock on the left very clearly looks like it is made up of bits of other rocks which is a classic example of our plastic rocks now just looking at this rock we know it's clastic what can you say about the grains within this rock remember clastic rocks are usually classified based on size of their grains would you say these grains are gravel sized sand size silt or clay you'd probably guess gravel because they're very easily identifiable with the naked eye and they're larger than two millimeters in diameter if we were to actually measure this now that would make this rock either a conglomerate or a branch of remember which of the two do you think this rock is it's a breccia because the grains are angular conglomerates contain grains that are more rounded see you can tell a lot about sedimentary rock just by looking at it and we know that this rock probably didn't travel very far from its source and maybe is the result of the landslide all right let's look at the rock on the right what sticks out at you when you're looking at this rock what's the first thing that you notice you probably notice an imprint of a seashell now with that observation what type of sedimentary rock would you likely classify it as would you classify it as clastic made up of bits of sediment and rock would you classify it as biological composed of biological material or would you classify it as chemical yeah this one's a little bit trickier because your instinct wants to say biological because you see an imprint of a shell but you're also not sure if it's one of those biochemical rocks that are a little trickier to classify well we can't consider this biochemical and this is an example of a limestone composed of the accumulation of shells and calcium carbonate that has been cemented together over time so this rock likely formed in a marine environment or a beach environment where we would find shells so not a lot of people know that sedimentary rocks actually play a significant role in the carbon cycle the carbon cycle refers to the movement of carbon throughout earth's spheres and has brought up a lot in conversation when talking about global climate change which we will explore later on this semester within this carbon cycle carbon dioxide or co2 is constantly moving from the atmosphere to the biosphere and back again this is one of the most active parts of the cycle when plants absorb co2 through photosynthesis and then release it again when they die some of the co2 when plants die end up being deposited in sediments and enters our rock cycle over geologic time a small amount of co2 is deposited as sediment but considerable amounts that are trapped get converted into fossil fuels of course we burn fossil fuels in large amounts causing that co2 to be released back into the atmosphere at much quicker rates than would occur naturally volcanoes also release carbon dioxide and limestone surprisingly is earth's largest repository of carbon here is a useful figure that summarizes the processes in the carbon cycle and this will be brought up again in module 14. in the next video we are going to start looking at sedimentary structures like ripple marks and mud cracks sounds exciting doesn't it i'll see you there

howdy everyone in this video of module 6 we will be talking about sedimentary structures sediment can have a variety of structures that are often preserved when they are lithified into a sedimentary rock some common structures that we see and will talk about include bedding cross beds graded bedding ripple marks mud cracks and even fossils let's start with the single most common feature of sedimentary rocks called stratum or beds strata or beds are the layers we often see in sedimentary rocks as pictured here but probably the most spectacular place to observe bedding is none other than the grand canyon here is a photo of dead horse point in moab utah just like the grand canyon you can see many layers of sedimentary rock that has been deposited horizontally forming beds or strata separating each layer from the next we call is a bedding plane now most sediments are deposited horizontally and laterally which we will again talk about in a future module on geologic time and that is what creates the structure yes that's me in the photo i took this picture during my field studies as an undergraduate student being a geology student sure has its perks now sometimes when we examine beds within a sedimentary rock we can see layers that are inclined this is called cross bedding and it is a major characteristic of sand dunes river deltas and certain stream deposits because it was formed by some kind of current whether that be wind or water here's a spectacular version of cross bedding in bryce canyon national park the really cool thing about cross bedding is that we can actually infer which direction the current was flowing at the time of the formation the crossbeds we see reflect the steep faces of ripples and dunes thus the steep faces tilt down current thus indicates which direction it must have been flowing like in this example the current was flowing from the right to the left again pretty cool stuff grated beds are another special type of bedding in this case we tend to see a gradual change from coarse grained at the bottom to fine grained at the top these types of bedding indicate rapid deposition because usually the heavy stuff will be deposited first followed by the lighter stuff on top which is exactly what happens during a turbidity current turbidity currents are a mass of sediment choked water that is denser than the clear water that moves downslope along the bottom of a lake or ocean kind of similar to a landslide however these are density driven flows rather than a gravity driven flow usually when we see graded bedding preserved in the rock we can infer that it formed in an underwater environment like a deep sea fan ripple marks are the small waves that are lithified in sedimentary rocks they are similar to cross bedding except these are preserved on the surface when we find ripple marks we know there must have been moving water or air mud cracks look like well mud cracks you've probably seen mud cracks before except here they're preserved in solid rock mud cracks indicate sediments formed in an environment that was once wet and dried then of course fossils are amazingly useful structures because they contain evidence of prehistoric life ripple marks just like cross bedding give us valuable information on moving air water because they too can tell us which direction it was flowing oscillation ripple marks occur in environments that have an oscillating movement of water or back and forth motion this usually occurs in a shallow near shore environment where we have waves coming in and coming out this creates symmetrical ripple marks because the current is flowing in both directions now current ripple marks occur where we have a unidirectional current meaning air or water is flowing from one main direction and just like cross beds the steeper sides occur in the down current direction allowing us to infer where the flow was coming from mud cracks also give us valuable information on the environment in which they were formed mud cracks indicate the sediment in which they were formed was alternately wet and dry when exposed to air wet mud often will dry out and shrink producing the cracks shown here mud cracks are associated with environments such as tidal flats shallow lakes and desert basins fossils again are any evidence of ancient life now this doesn't have to be just the remains of an organism like we see on the right but they can even include things like burrows like these ancient worm burrows preserved in the rock on the left fossils are important in understanding the evolution of earth and life itself and they are also really great at indicating time in correlating rocks from different time periods which is a topic we'll discuss in a future module in the next and final video of this module we will continue talking about how sedimentary rocks can tell us about the geologic history environment and climate of an area in the past hang tight i promise you're almost there

welcome to the final video of this module i hope by this point you realize some of the way sedimentary rocks can tell us about earth's past environments this last video sums that all up the figure is on page 222 and 223 are also very nice summaries of this topic sedimentary rocks give us a glimpse of what the environment was hundreds or thousands or even millions of years ago when it formed an environment of deposition or sedimentary environment refers to the geographic setting where the sediment accumulated and they determine the nature of the sediments like the grain size shape and composition which we already discussed in previous videos there are three broad categories of sedimentary environments and we quite simply call them continental marine and transitional continental environments are dominated by stream erosion and deposition because streams are the dominant agent and changing the landscape we also see glacial deposits here which are typically those very poorly sorted sediments we briefly mentioned in the classic rock video and they range from clay size to boulder size and grain and then we have eolian deposits which is a fancy word for wind deposits these are typically well sorted and fine grained here's one of those figures i was talking about and this one can be found on page 222 of your textbook very nicely summarizes what we can expect to find at many continental environments for example in caves we would expect to find limestone because this is where that calcium carbonate was precipitated from groundwater and it can sometimes create rocks like this drip stone shown here in deserts we can expect sand dunes consisting of well sorted sand grains deposited by the winds and may even find sedimentary structures like cross bedding alluvial fans which can be found at the base of mountains consist of coarser grain sediments that have been dumped down mountain streams and settle at the base we might see brunches and maybe even conglomerates here that contain those gravel-sized grains that haven't traveled relatively too far from their source inland seas and lakes and dry environments are great places we might expect to find those evaporites like rock salt and gypsums similar to the bonneville salt flats we talked about a few videos ago landslides can produce an unsorted jumble of a mess so we can expect brechus being found here swamps and bogs are great places for coal formation because of the mud and decayed plant material that accumulates here so expect to find coal streams transport a variety of sediment sizes but once they reach low lying areas the sediments left are often mud-sized so silts and clays and sand in streams in the lowlands we would expect to find sandstones siltstones and mudstones we might even find those current ripple marks that might tell us which way the stream was flowing glacial deposits can be found where we have glaciers and often consist of poorly sorted mixture of many different sized particles that have been picked up by the moving ice and dumped elsewhere so as you can see when we find sedimentary rocks we have a pretty good idea of what kind of environment they must have formed in even if the environment where they are today looks very different thanks to plate tectonics marine depositional environments are divided according to depths shallow marine environments reach depths to about 200 meters which is 700 feet deep these environments border the world's continents and receive huge amounts of terrestrial sediments meaning sediments that have eroded from the continents so usually rich in silica so here we tend to find clastic rocks like sandstones and silt stones warm seas that do not receive very much sediment from the continents often produce carbonate-rich muds and debris from coral reefs which form limestones deep marine environments lie seaward of the continental shelf and beyond so usually deeper than 700 feet the farther out we go from the coasts the less and less sediment is accumulated and the smaller and smaller the grains become remember the farther the grains travel the smaller they usually become this is why we primarily find fine-grained sediments like clay on the ocean floor and that produces shales now sometimes there are exceptions like when we have turbidity currents that form that graded bedding that we talked about and submarine landslides these processes can carry coarser grain sediment deeper out into the ocean when we find coarse grained sediment in deep marine environments then we know something chaotic has happened transitional environments consist of the shoreline where it is both continental and marine like a beach tidal flat barrier islands lagoons and deltas here we can find deposits of sand or gravel on beaches mud on tidal flight flats and even reefs that create lagoons here's another one of those figures i talked about that shows the marine and transitional environments very nicely on page 223 in your textbook and this shows what we can expect to find at the various locations here on beaches that have strong wave activity like the northwest united states the beaches consist mainly of pebbles and cobbles and can form conglomerates beaches and bars along low-lying coasts like the east coast are typically composed of well-sorted sand and shell fragments creating sandstones and maybe even limestones like coquina tidal flats and lagoons are areas where we expect to find fine-grained clay or carbonate-rich muds forming shales and limestones way out in the deep marine environments we mainly expect to find shales and limestones but sometimes we can find fine-grained sand and gravels where sediment has been carried out by a turbidity current or submarine landslide which i know a lot about shallow marine environments is where we can expect to find sand clay and carbonate-rich muds forming sandstones shales and limestones and these often have ripple marks preserving the wave activity here and then our coral reefs are massive limestone structures that form in shallow clear seas and consist of materials secreted by corals and other marine life when we study sedimentary layers sometimes we see a successive change in an environment that occurred at one place over time the terms for each of these units is called faces and each faces has distinctive set of characteristics reflecting certain conditions for example we might see a sand which was deposited on a beach on top of mud which is deposited further offshore typically and we can then infer that the sea level must have changed to have these two distinct faces occurring in the same location the transition between the faces tends to be gradual but are useful to tolls and infer and past climates here's an example of different faces we see that change laterally closer to the shore we have the sandstone faces because the sediment deposited here is coarser grain whereas you continue to travel farther outwards the grains tend to be smaller and we start producing a shale faces and if you continue traveling outwards sometimes there is very little sediment left so we start depositing carbonate rich oozes from the marine life out here forming a limestone feces alright so hopefully you know and see why it is important to study sedimentary rocks you should now have all the information you need to complete the participation activity i highly recommend reading over chapters six and seven especially sections 6.4 6.6 and 6.8 and chapter 6. and sections 7.7 and 7.8 in chapter 7 before the quiz if you haven't already as always please reach out if you have any questions at all and good luck
